It's caused by hormonal changes and can manifest as small, red, raised bumps or pimples on the face, torso, and arms.\n3.

Rabies is a serious disease that can be prevented with proper treatment.Regarding your question, it's generally not recommended to consume alcohol while taking Rabipur shots. Here's why:1. Interaction with the vaccine: Rabipur is a live vaccine, and alcohol can affect its efficacy. Consuming alcohol during the vaccination period may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness in providing adequate protection against rabies.\n2.
