This exemption is provided under Section 106 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).There are a few reasons why company-provided health insurance is considered a fringe benefit:1. Historical context: The tax exemption for employer-sponsored health insurance dates back to the 1940s, when the Internal Revenue Code was first enacted. At that time, employers were encouraged to provide health insurance to their employees as a way to attract and retain talent, and the tax exemption was seen as a way to incentivize this practice.\n2.

It's typically a percentage of the purchase price, and it's usually required to secure the mortgage. The down payment amount varies depending on the type of mortgage and the lender. For a conventional loan, a 20% down payment is typically recommended, but you can put down as little as 3-5% with a government-backed loan like FHA or VA.For example, if the home costs $200,000, a 20% down payment would be $40,000. However, you might put down 5% or 10% and finance the remaining amount with a mortgage.2.

Here's how it affects the country's economy:1. **Inflation**: A high debt-to-GDP ratio can lead to higher inflation. When a government borrows heavily, it injects more money into the economy, which can increase the money supply and drive up prices. This can erode the purchasing power of citizens and reduce the value of their savings.\n2. **Interest payments**: A high debt-to-GDP ratio means that a significant portion of the government's budget is dedicated to interest payments on its debt. This can limit the government's ability to invest in other important areas, such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n3. **Credit rating**: A high debt-to-GDP ratio can negatively impact a country's credit rating. This can make it more expensive for the government to borrow money in the future, as lenders demand higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.\n4. **Economic growth**: A high debt-to-GDP ratio can slow down economic growth.

High-interest debt: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt with an interest rate above 15%, it might make sense to use a non-tax-advantaged investment account to pay off the debt. The interest rate on your debt is likely higher than the expected return on your investments, so paying off the debt could be a more financially savvy move.\n2.
