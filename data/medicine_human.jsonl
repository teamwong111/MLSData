Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth.

And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown", "lang": "en", "label": 1, "source": "medicine_human"}

Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1. If she has other allergies or wheezing, asthma is very likely. In that case, I would prescribe her salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-neede basis. I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3. If any of above is not there, I would like to ask her symptoms in great detail to know whether she needs a cardiac evaluation. As she is young (29 years), anemia and asthma are more common possibilities rather than cardiac disease.

Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI. So follow these instructions. You need not be afraid for that additional 'period' since it was due to discontinuation of Duoluton.

{"question": "腰间盘突出和强制性脊柱炎有何区别？ 发病有七年，腰痛，腰直。", "idx": 302, "text": "腰椎间盘突出，多数是由于长期的不合理姿势所导致。最初的表现只是姿势不正弯腰驼背，局部的过度受力，时间久了会造成软组织的慢性损伤，形成腰肌劳损等慢性腰痛，所以也称姿势性腰痛，而腰椎间盘突出则是在此基础之上进一步积累的结果。所以，矫正姿势是关键中的关键的，合理的姿势是康复运动的基础和前提。否则，病因的问题不解决，只能是反复复发，恶性循环，越来越重。腰椎间盘突出的保守治疗方法，目前公认效果最好的是倒走。其根本，就是作为反向运动，能有效强制人体重心后移，减小腰椎前凸，从而矫正姿势，（有时间可以试试倒走，倒走注意穿平底鞋小步子慢走，要选择安全的地带进行倒走锻炼）。倒走时能强制人体重心后移，矫正脊柱的过度弯曲，只是倒走不容易坚持，也不太安全。站立的时候也可以强制重心后移。赤足或穿平底鞋站立，前脚掌踩一本20毫米左右厚的书，这样脚处于前高后低的状态，同样可以强制重心后移，可以体验一下，体验时间越长越好。如果感觉症状有减轻，为了便于坚持，可以考虑选用鞋底为前高后低的专利负跟鞋，和倒走原理相同。在日常生活中坚持使用，就等于把强制重心后移的姿势矫正，延伸到日常生活之中，可作为倒走的替代，且更安全，更有利于效果的巩固，与现有的治疗康复方法都不矛盾，还具有补充、强化和巩固的作用，而且是有益无害。矫正姿势必须要矫正重心，负跟鞋是一个最简单的方法，因为鞋是人的“地基”，直接影响人体重心位置。高跟鞋会导致和加重腰痛，就是因为它会导致重心前移，那么前高后低的负跟鞋，必然强制人体重心后移，矫正姿势的康复作用就很容易理解了。专利负跟鞋在发达的欧美国家比较常见。在日本最为普及，特别是腰痛患者，对此好评如潮。在国内，有些三甲医院可以买到，可以向专家咨询。更多可以参考：科技日报《腰椎间盘突出选择须理性》大众科技报《腰椎间盘突出矫正“地基”很关键》", "lang": "zh", "label": 1, "source": "medicine_human"}
