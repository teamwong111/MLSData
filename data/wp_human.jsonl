{"text": "As the stars flew idly by the viewscreen, Gryxnecht lolled lazily in his gravity harness. The usual sights in Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha had long ago become stale like a loaf of H'Cherft that was left out for too long. He eyed the status panel and seeing that it was not actively blinking, decided a snooze was in order. Transporting cargo across the spiral arms of the galaxy was tiring work after all. Alarms awoke Gryxnecht. How long had they been going off? He was faintly aware of them during his dream state but the realization that an emergency was happening only dawned on him after he wiped the crust from his eye stalks. Commander Gryxnecht, a vessel has interfaced with our docking unit., the garbled mechanical voice reverberated in his mind. A vessel? Docked? None of this made any sense. He was light years from any major thoroughfares and no one came here anymore, not for at least a few millennia. Gryx deactivated the photonic harness holding him in place, silenced the alarm, and writhed out the control room. Slithering down the corridor, he was unsure of what to expect. Was it Vex'Thal pirates? No, they shoot first and board later. It must be a random company inspection. Gryx had previously been audited about how he had managed to deliver freight faster than any of his competitors and he had been mum about his routes. The company must have tailed him here and wanted to make sure he wasn't dumping cargo or selling it off to another client. The sight of them struck him dumb for a moment. Some bipedal thing climbed out of the docking hatch. It appeared to be wearing a suit, as the multitude of surfaces and facets did not look organic. The top of the thing was a spherical dome with a metallo-reflective surface. These were not any sentient life-forms that were a part of the Argonus Galactic Confederation of Species. Standing straight, the entity bared 2 lower appendages and 2 upper appendages, the upper two sprouting 5 more smaller appendages at the ends. More than a little apprehensive, Gryxnecht moved slowly towards the being. It did not appear to be making any hostile movements, other than waving one of its upper appendages slowly back and forth. You have boarded a private cargo vessel. State your business and intentions.. Gryx couldn't sense where the entities receiving node was located. The layers of this beings outerware must be interfering with it. The biped reached to his side and brought up a black box, apparently jabbing at some interface that Gryx could only guess at. A moment later the box vibrated, Hello, We come in Peace That's a relief. The newcomer used both his upper appendages to reach up over his dome-shaped mask and unlatched whatever mechanism that was holding it in place and began to lift it off. A protective suit... I knew it. But the sense of ease and understanding was rapidly replaced with renewed shock and then abject horror. As the dome was removed, Gryx could see the organism for what it really was. As a larval youngling, caretakers would scare them with stories of beings that emitted horrible wavelengths that caused your brains to explode. Screechers. Turning, Gryxnecht wanted to put as many walls between him and those creatures as possible. This could not be happening, those things were just fairy tales told to scare younglings. He made for the door but it was too late. He reeled as the wavelengths passed through his receiving node. As they bounced and echoed inside the fluid chamber that held it, striking the node again and again. A blinding and thunderous pain that caused violent spasms of his eye stalks and tentacles. Gryx fell to the bulkhead floor, his brain having been vibrated to paste and his fluids leaking out of him. - Captain Alexander Heart was stunned by the amount of gore that spewed from this alien creature. He had used the communication device that NASA gave him. Something about the aliens only being able to communicate in ultra-low wavelengths. The words of greetings fresh on his lips... he now bit them. Turning to Lieutenant Dale Kargrove, who was climbing out of the hatch behind him, Alex asked, \" Was it something I said? \"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 2, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "The damned didnt scream. It was silent all throughout the hellscape. Eternity has worn on the tortured souls, even writhing was beyond them. They all looked the same, I noted, wearing the cloth of thousands of metallic wires, scraping off the ever further scarring skin with every labored movement. Their path was a mystery to even those who delve into this world for research, for a living. The endless lines stretched across the grey expanse. Color could no longer exist in the presence of such agony. I switched off the room, writing my first experience of hell into my journal before it wrote itself into my psyche. The worst part was that I knew some of those people, this machine took me to people I would recognize. Not by face, but by deeds. I saw my rapist, gaunt face bobbing as he was marching forward, the most profound fear and pain I've ever seen. I saw my grandfather, the man who put me through college, and earned me my best job, and even introduced me to my wife. He suffered the same torture. After weeks, and many warnings from my colleagues, I switched the machine back on, and chose the setting \"heaven\" None of what I was told could prepare me for what I saw. I was taken through the tunnel, or what we perceive as a tunnel, and was deposited into a softly lit room. I was acknowledged by the short, cute brunette sitting at a desk against the center of the wall. She looked up at me with passing interest, and I wondered how she reacted to the first few living visitors. She gestured to a door with patience, and said I was allowed 10 minutes. I found this curious, as many friends of mine spent a much longer time in there, rest their souls. I entered and gasped; it was beautiful. I was told it would be, and that I should take solace in that. I could earn my way there, I was told. We all could. Walked through the forests, and deserts, and the tundra, the beautiful landscapes dotted by happy looking homes of the inhabitants. I was told to never enter them, but I only had three minutes left after exploring for what seemed like hours, and my curiosity had bested me. I chose a quaint bungalow on a private looking beach, and I knocked. I waited for what felt like 20 minutes, though only 1 had passed. Finally, I decided I needed to see, I had to know how I could possibly live in heaven one day. I still had a minute and a half left when I logged out of the machine, vomiting and sobbing. They were dead. The family of 5 was sitting at the table, pre-emaciated, and now rotted. The baby was in his mother's lap, against her stomach, held to the very end of their second lives. I tried to seek out others who would speak of the experience, and found a new friend, someone who walked in on a similar scene, a mother with two daughters, sitting by a fire, though the affects of weather weren't felt in that world, also emaciated, also rotted. It seems that everyone has starved to death. There is little food in heaven. I learned later, that one can die of many things in heaven. Starvation, physical attacks from others, and even accidents. Worst of all, though, is that even if one were able to easily eat in heaven, many people were found to have died of old age. Heaven is an unsustainable eternity, ending for those who earned it, in non-existence. I'm almost glad grandpa went to hell.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 4, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Cold. So cold. At least the view was nice. We drifted on in silence, my wife and I. Call it a clerical error, call it sabotage. It didn't really matter. Ground control didn't see the asteroid belt and neither did we until we struck it. Our ship was torn apart within minutes and both of us had been sucked out. The cosmic dust was our only other companion. Immortality seemed like the worst choice to make. They first few moments were the worst. First my lungs exploded with the force of a thousand hammers, hitting just the right nails, and all I could do was watch the same happen to her just seconds later. I just kept staring at her. Her already pale skin wept as the bright reds of her wrinkled lips escaped their master. I remembered her walking out of the shower, just a towel wrapped around her. How she'd walk over to me, sleeping in and lean forward, brushing her speaking hair against my face as I smiled in my complacent sleep. The same hair that floated in every direction with us. I held her tighter and she held me the same. I kissed her icy forehead as I saw the tears escape our eyes, clump together and drift away as aimlessly as us. I tried to remember our time on earth. I remember her family on Christmas. Everyone one of them more dull than the next. I remember us running away close to midnight. Making our way to the park in the country side and lying down. Just looking in awe at the same stars that now mocked our immortality. Her smiling head against the night sky as she kissed me juxtaposed with my current view of her silently sobbing visage. I kept trying to remember more. I remember a fight. We fought about this. We fought about immortality. She never wanted to become immortal and go into space. In fact..... She didn't agree to it. I felt my mind betray me as her warmth faded away. I looked up at the galaxies swirling into the abyss. She left me. Cold. So cold.

Expensive suits and gold watches. Muttering arising. Cameras flashed and microphones turned on. \"Settle down, please. Jones go first\" said Phil. \"Mr. Goodman, we understand that your company has been charged with conspiracy, kidnapping and crimes against humanity and human nature. What is your stance on that accusations?\" \"These accusations are ridiculous. Alive Corp has done nothing more in the last four years than providing for you and your loved ones.

Nobody heard Phil. Everyone was shouting things at him. He nodded to the cameras and left the room the same way he entered. Behind him the heavy metal doors made a clicking sound. The light in the room switched off. A scream. And another. A gurgling sound. Soon the room was full of screaming, as it was screaming itself. Phil didn't worry. He knew that the room was sealed tight. He was both pleased and sad. Sad that all those people had to turn and pleased that he was on this side of the door. Pleased with the big fat raise he was going to get after all that new product he got in. And what a great product that was. Big time reporters, philanthropists, celebrities.

{"text": "I walked a long dirt road back to a town I had visited just 3 weeks ago. As I approached the gate I was smiling, remembering what I had done here. Under orders of the king I had gone to a nearby cave and slew a horde of goblins. The king paid me handsomely, but the real reward was fighting for the people of this great kingdom. I knocked on the gate, but there was no answer. I waited a moment and then knocked again. Still nothing. I tried to pull open the door, and surprisingly it opened with no resistance. No locks? This seemed odd. My smile faded as I became curious about the situation that we now faced. The town seemed empty. As it was the late in the afternoon, this seemed very odd. Maybe there was a festival going on. Though that wouldn't explain why the gate's door was left unlocked. Determined to solve this mystery, I thought to confront the king and asked what was going on. The palace was also eerily silent. It almost seemed as if the entire town had just left all at once. The first sign of life was in the throne room. Or maybe \"sign of life\" was the wrong thing to call it. There was an ornately robed skeleton sitting on the throne, wearing the king's crown. Was it the king's skeleton? Perhaps. But how had the king died? The sun set, and simultaneously the skeleton seemed to come to life, blue flames filling out the bones. He turned his \"eyes\" to me. \"Ah. You have returned. How do you feel about the changes we've made?\" I was horrified. So the king was not dead? Suddenly skeleton soldiers entered the room and took to their stations. Though they had no skin, I could tell that they were just waking up. \"What happened here? What killed you all?\" The king laughed. \"Why, you did great warrior. Or at least, you helped us to achieve this goal. You see, I had been trying for years to unearth the secret to immortality, the lich's relic. But far too long there were monsters guarding it. After you dispatched those goblins so easily, I quickly took the power and bestowed its gift upon the entire village. Soon, we will convert the kingdom. Huzzah for the Hero of Legend!\" \"Huzzah!\" cried the skeleton army raising their spears in unison. They moved to surround me. Anxious about fighting these monsters I pulled out my sword, but the closest skeleton grabbed my wrist and raised it for the crowd. \"Huzzah!\" they cried once again. They lifted me and set me in a highly decorated chair. Once I was settled they lifted the chair. They walked me out of the palace and then I saw the population of the town. As soon as their skeletal bodies noticed me, they would bow. I heard many mutterings about heroes and legends but I still couldn't get the surprised scowl off of my face. I did this to them. I made an entire village into an undead menace. And they revered me.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 11, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "I sat on the floor of my tiny studio staring at my hands that were still shaking violently. I clenched my fists tight taking in a deep breath. \"Just a dream.\" I said trying to calm down. I stood up and walked over to the pantry and found the last of my Jack Daniels. I put it into an Owl shaped mug and within a few swigs it was gone. I felt my eyes get tired again and laid on my bed. \"No dreams.\" I said to my brain of course it didn't listen. It had been only a few months since I was approached by a homeless man who wanted to give me a \"gift\" for buying him a hot meal. Some gift. I hadn't slept in days and when I did sleep the dreams came. Horrible visions of what could happen not would but could. I could see the future but there were two flaws to this. The future wasn't set in stone so say someone wants to shoot up a school, they go to bed believing they are going to shoot up the school kill whoever then kill themselves but they wake up and something changes their mind, maybe they're favorite cereal was on sale, doesn't matter cause they choose not to shoot up the school. I get to see them actually do it, the people screaming for mercy, the jock pissing his pants when faced with death all of it. When this gift first happened I would cry wolf every time. Most of the time I was right but of course the media only got wind of when I was wrong and it wasn't long before I was written off as a crazy person who lucked out on a few right calls. The second was that the only time the dreams stopped was when I drank heavily, which made me develop a drinking habit that would put an Irishman to shame. I rolled out of bed seeing the clock say it was almost 10:00 am. I sat up and got dressed grabbed my wallet and started my walk to the store. I had moved twice since getting the \" gift \" and now lived off of whatever money my parents sent me. They were sure I was having a mental breakdown and forced to go to counseling to get their checks every month. My head spun back and forth as I made it to Albertsons. I filled my cart with Gatorade, bread, peanut butter, jelly, bananas and of course whiskey. I must have smelt horrid because people made sure to avoid me as I checked out. I walked out the store and walked through the parking lot. I didn't hear it but a car backed up beside me and bumped my hip. I turned and screamed at it. \" Watch where you're fucking going! \" I screamed. I looked at the rearview mirror and saw a set of very familiar piercing green eyes. I felt my heart sink and I dropped my bags. I wanted to be angry but the pure shock was still racing through me. He stepped out of the car and I barely recognized him. The skinny, smelly homeless man with a scraggly beard and stringy hair was now standing tall. His face was clean and he wore a polo shirt and jeans. \" Hello, Sarah. \" He said. He voice wasn't as raspy as it was and I swore he even looked younger. I felt the shock begin to wear off and rage replaced it. \" You! \" I screamed and ran at him. I grabbed his shirt. \" You fucking piece of dog shit! Do you know what you've done to me? \" I yelled at the top of my lungs. He wasn't fazed. \" Yes. \" He said. No remorse or guilt just a stern affirmation. I let him go and put my hand out. \" Take it back! I can't take this anymore! Please! \" I screamed. He sighed and shook his head. \" I'm sorry Sarah but no. \" \" Take it or I'll make you! \" I screamed. He smiled and laughed a little. \" Sorry but you can only receive the gift if you want it. I don't want it. \" He went to get back in his but I grabbed him. I fell to my knees my eyes swollen with tears. \" Please! I can't do this! \" I said. He pulled his arm away. \" You think you have it rough! I was stuck with that thing for five year! I lost my wife, kids, and job and was fucking living on the streets eating garbage! \" He grabbed me by my hair and tossed me away from his car. \" You've had it for five fucking months! You want to get rid of it find some sad sap to take it just like I did! \" He jumped in his car and sped away. I got to my feet and started walking. I felt my feet moving as I contemplated what he said. Was I willing to put this burden on some poor new sap? I got home with only the bottle of whiskey and sat on my bed. I walked to the medicine cabinet and pulled out a bottle of Tylenol and one by one took every single pill. I laid on the bed and started to cry not from the fear of dying, it couldn't be all that bad, but from relief that pretty soon it would all be over. My eyes finally grew heavy and I went into my dreamless sleep.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 12, "lang": "en"}

My mother did not move or speak or even draw a breath, no matter what they did to her.

She had begun to smell, too, a harsh reeking scent that lingered in her sickbed long after she had been taken from it. At the hospital, they treated her poorly. The room they gave her was small and poorly lit, tucked away in a corner of the building. The nurses brought her neither food and water to make her stay more comfortable nor medicine to hasten her recovery. Each day I sat by her side and waited for the healing that was inevitable and yet seemed so far off. Their treatment of my mother made me angrier and angrier and angrier, until at last, one bright morning, I pulled her limp form the bed, sure that I could care for her just as well at home as these fools could here. I wish I had not. When I touched her, her flesh was loose and ripe and sagging. The stench was overwhelming, and only grew stronger as I tried to wrap my arms around her. And- and when- It pains me to form the words. I can not talk about what I saw that day without seeing it once again in my mind. But you deserve to know. When I pulled my mother from the bed, the skin of her face, her eyes, her lips- it split. And within her were worms, white and squirming, making a meal of her flesh. I remember little beyond that; it is all bits of memory and flashes of emotion, blurred together in my mind. I know I screamed and brought the doctors running, and then fought them until they were forced to sedate me. I know that when I was brought to, my mother..... no. Not my mother. What was left of my mother, the thing that sat in the hospital bed- it was gone. They had taken it, to where I do not know. They told me not to speak of what had happened to anyone, on pain of a thousand years' imprisonment. But I must tell you, so that when the time comes you will not be so terrified as I was. I can feel it. There is a heaviness pressing down on me, a stiff sour coldness in my limbs that I have never felt before. When I saw what had happened to my mother- what had become of her- something changed within me. The worm are inside me, too. I can feel them when I sleep, their tiny bodies burrowing phantom holes all through me. I know not how long it will take- days or months or decades- but somebody I will become like my mother, gone somewhere far away with nothing but meat and worms left where I once was. When that time comes, do not wait by my bedside. I do not want you to see what will become of me. I do not want the worms to burrow their way into you.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 20, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "The first chevron locked into place. The sound seeming to boom though the hidden mountian complex. As the second chevron locked the men had began to stir and recheck their weapons. They had known this day was coming, the whole world had. After the first attack had been turned away they had revealed the secret of the gate to the world. As the third chevron locked they started to get reports from the satalites in space. They had known they were coming, they had seen the scout ships coming in and out of system for days. But now, now there were five large pyramid shapped ships sitting between the moon and the planet. The bombardment started with the forth chevron. Whole cities were wipped off the map in an instant. Some of the soilders started to wonder what the point of coming through the gate was if they were just going to glass the planet. By the time the fifth chevron had lit up all of the planets nuclear missiles had been spent in a failed attempt to stop the encroaching ships that now sat at the top of the gravity well. By the time the sixth chevron locked into place the mountain had lost contact with the outside world, their power only coming from the generators deep in the heart of the complex. When the seventh chevron locked the men said a quick prayer as the room was washed in blue white light. For the next several minuites all that could be heard was the sound of gunfire as round after round was expended at the golden armored troops walking though the gate. But it was not enough to stem the tide. The superhuman soldiers just kept coming though the gate, their faces hidden behind animal like masks. The few soilders that were left heard the voice of their commander come over the speaker \"All is lost they are though the gate. retreat to the outer rooms and await evac.\" 400 years later. This time when the chevrons lit up there was no one to take note, no one to notice the sound of metal sliding over metal. There were no messages or sounds of explosions as the fourth chevron locked and no silent prayers as the gate lit up and spewed forth. Instead of golden armored troops four people clad in camo stepped onto the platform that held the ring. \"What do you think danny-boy? Some kind of old temple?\" Jack asked placing his sunglasses on his head. \"No actually it looks like we are inside of, well a mountain.\" Daniel said after a minute of shining a flashlight over the walls.\" \"Well It makes sense, I mean we wouldn't be the only ones with the idea to hide the gate away in a mountain.\" Samantha said. \"Spooky is what it is.\" Said jack glancing down at the discarded guns and empty magazines. \"Ok lets just do a quick look around and then get out of here.\" AN: Sorry im on a stargate binge right now so I heard gate and this was my first thought. At first I wanted to do something with the wraith and the ancients then it turned into the goauld. Also I was debating as I wrote if I should do it based on one of the planets in the \"Mirror, Mirror\" Episode that ended getting destroyed when the Goauld invaded their world.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 21, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "...\"You're not very good at following directions, are you, Mr. Anderson?\" \"Ha Ha Haa Mike, that joke never gets old.\" I breathed absentmindedly into the phones reciever. Lodging it firmly into the crook of my shoulder, I opened the fridge and grabbed the milk, 2. \"So this letter, your idea of getting into the spirit for the last Matrix film? I'm pretty stoked about it,\" I lied. \"I always considered myself to be the yellow Morpheus. Anyway, what are you getting into tonight, broski? Or rather, who are you getting into?\" I poured the cool moo-juice over my cheerios, honey nut. It had been a shitty day at the office. Huge list, no sales. Being a telemarketer in the age of cell phones was not an easy thing to do, espically after the'Do Not Call List' took almost all the new numbers out of my grasp. These little circles were my comfort food. \"I'm married, my young batchelor friend.\" \"That's right, youve found'The One (I swear I could hear him do finger quotes over the telephone; instantly confirmed by a loud FUCK as he died in his videogame, C.O.D.) \"Any way bro, I'm bored. And I know Alice is out of town. Lets DO something. You promised you wouldnt turn into an old couple. It was litterally my only requirement to being your best man.\" \"Not tonight, Mike. I have a few chapters in a book I'd like to make some headway in.\" \"And what do chapters rhyme with?\" there was a silence, and then he came right back in, \"Guiness. I'll be over in an hour.\" \"What?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"Chapters does not...\" \"Sweet deal bro. Catch ya in a bit.\" And the phone hung up with a click. I flipped the phone close.'Damn' I thought,'There goes my night. I should have never gone to see The Matrix that friday night back in college. What were the odds the main character and I shared the same last name?' I shook my head and went back to my 8 grains of heart health. I flipped on the T.V. \"Up next, an ABC origional, LOST\" the speakers shouted to a near deserted house. \"Ugh\" I said to the no one in the room, \"I'm not going to sit through one of their train wrecks again. NEXT!\" I flipped a few channels before landing on the CN and a replay of an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. That wraskly wrabbit, I almost shot milk out my nose when he came out dressed as a girl bunny. Man, the things they could get away with back then. I put the bowl in the sink, after drinking all the honey milk. I turned to find the towel to dry my hands. \"Ugh, better go get changed, Mike'll be here in 30 min.\" I thought. Out the kitchen, towards the front staircase, and my pinky toe catches the table Alice had just bought. \"Fuck!\" immediatly burst from my mouth. \"Of all the places to put a table, she HAD to pick the narrow hallway.\" I grumbeled angrily, and kicked the table with my other foot. Dumb idea. pain in blinding me and I succomb to a kneeling fetal position, holding my toes. I almost missed it, but there was something written on the underside of the table. Not words, but a number. ten digits.'This has got to be another one of Mike's dumb Matrix jokes that he got Allison involved in.' I thought to myself.'Joke's on you bud, two can play that game.' Ten punches later and the phone is ringing. click Hello, Mr. Anderson. We've been expecting your call for awhile now. \"Yea, I bet you have. Look man, I know what Mike is up to. Honestly, I dont have time for this shit, what does he have in store tonight.\" static Mr. Anderson, inside that table is a picture. I want you to look at it. \"Dude, seriously? Did you not hear me? I don't want to play any games. a breath Mr. Anderson, I reccomend that you look at the picture. \"Fine, dickhead, I'll play your stupid fuc...\" inside the drawyer was what looked like a prop from a Star Trek episode. As I touched it, it started playing a video. In the middle of an empty room was a figure tied to a chair, her long blonde hair hanging drown from her hunched over head. \"What the fuck is going on here.\" static Please don't use that language, Mr. Anderson. You're wife dosn't appreciate it. ...\"Baby?\" I whispered static What is her name, Mr. Anderson. \"What game are you playing at!?\" I shouted. Her name, Mr. Anderson. \"Alice! Her name is Alice.\" Wait, was it? \"No, it's Allison.\" pause Which is it, Mr. Anderson? 'Why couldnt I remember?' I thought. I shook my head, to clear it. \"It's Alice.\" At that, another figure came into the screen. DING DONG I ripped open the door, grabbed Mike by the collar, and threw him against the wall. \"TO FUCKING FAR MIKE!!!\" His feet were no longer on the floor. \"Bro, what are you talking about?!?\" He yelled back down at me there was a silence for a long moment. from my phone that had dropped to the floor I told you not to use that language, Mr. Anderson. I grabbed the screen and stared at it helplessly. I could tell that this man woke up my wife with smelling salts. Her lashing out at him was returned with a backhand to her face. with her still, he ssqueezed a visquious liquid out of a bottle, coverering her in a drizzel. I'll tell you, I take no joy in this Mr. Anderson. But you must pay for what you have done. Mike looked at me, \"Dude, whats going on?\" I put a finger up to him as I taked into the phone. \"You have the wrong fucking guy.\" Sigh I warned you about language, Mr. Anderson. Now you must see that I am a man of my word. Do you know how Africanized Honey Bees react when they smell honey that is not theirs? The screen flipped to an infrared. Hundreds of little dots were zipping accross the screen. I could see Alice jerking back in forth. I knew she was screaming in pain, but all I heard was the silence of the phone. \"Why are you doing this?\" I asked Why, Mr. Anderson? Because you need to suffer. click", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 22, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "\"In here, Professor.\" said the curly haired man, as he slid an ID card through the simple slot next to the massive gleaming steel door. As Professor Stone shuffled nervously through the door into the gloom, his eyes began to adjust. The space was deceptively small and put him in the mood of a storeroom. One small window was covered, and the lamp had been removed from the ceiling. The only light he had to guide himself came from the dim glow of some black-lights, which had been arranged around the object, along with a sophisticated toolbox. He almost tripped, and looked down to find thick cables snaked from the lights to outlets on the walls. It was quiet, and yet he almost felt as though someone was breathing on his neck. The hairs on the back of his arms began to stand on end. He turned to the curly haired agent, who had entered behind him. \"Why are there no decent lights in here?\" he said. \"We'd rather people didn't take any decent photographs yet.\" said the agent. The professor noticed his name-tag said Evans. \"Besides, something about it disturbs people when they look at it in the light.\" Stone had to admit to himself that he understood what they meant. Even in this limited light, the probe felt foreboding, like it took up too much room for the size it was. When you tried to look away, your eyes couldn't help but slide back. He shivered. He felt like it was going to pounce. Which was absurd. It was a machine, not some alien creature. He suddenly wished very fervently that he hadn't thought of that. \"I'll be back later, Doc.\" said Evans, his voice a long drawl. \"Remember, just check it out and give us your opinion on whether it's the real deal.\" Before Stone could ask any questions the man was gone. A feeling stole over him that he wasn't the first to have done this. It would only make sense, he wasn't exactly the greatest expert on Voyager 1. He glanced at it. Was it Voyager 1? It certainly looked right, at least from the outside. He sighed, and rolled up his sleeves. Some hours later, Agent Evans returned to find the Professor sat carefully against a wall, looking tired. The probe was once again open to the world. \"Well?\" he asked. \"It's not ours, but you knew that already,\" said Stone. \"It's certainly very similar but it's put together slightly differently. Screws in different places, that sort of thing. Mind you, some of the capacitors look very strange. How was it replaced? Come to think of it, how did you bring it back from so far out?\" \"We didn't.\" said Evans, the corner of his mouth turning up slightly. \"This is the one we found on Europa. That alone took a lot of effort.\" The Professor blinked. It was something he hadn't considered. He thought for a moment. A hoax? \"What I don't get is how anyone pulled something like this off,\" he said, his brow furrowing. \"Who else had the resources to get this out there without us knowing?\" The agent gave a smile so horrible that the rest of his face seemed to want to sidle away. \"We don't think it came from Russia,\" he said. The look in his eyes could give a man nightmares. \"The Golden Record gave us some hints.\" \"Can I see it?\" said Stone, eagerness pouring out of him like a tap. \"Any differences?\" \"Well, it's busy elsewhere at the moment,\" said Evans, his tone hollow. \"Still, I'll tell you some things. None of the languages match anything we know. Even the top linguists can't trace them to anything common.\" He paused. His face was taking on a waxy sheen. \"The music, well that was just noise. Screeching and deep rumbling. Either the record was damaged, or...\" his voice trailed off. \"What about the images?\" said Stone, almost against his will. The Agent was starting to disturb him. \"Oh, those came out fine.\" said Evans, his voice strained, as though he was talking from a great distance away. \"I've never seen any tripedal humans before. Maybe that's why they all look so angry in the pictures.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 23, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Hello YouTube, welcome to this week's episode of Making Movies On A Budget. I'm here in the studio with my mate Ralph and Well, the studio is actually my mom's living, the usual studio is getting fumigated. Right, yes, we're here in Ralph's mom's living room, and this week we are going to tackle the issue of backgrounds. So if you're a regular of our show, you already know the basics for a dynamic scene, but there is more to it than just the action and dialog. Ralph? That's right, the wrong setup can kill your scene faster than anything. Fortunately the solution is easy-peasy. You just dream it up! So for this you will only need your trusty video editor, an expert imaging sistem and a pillow. Now, you want to load up your dream from the pillow into the editor We already have this thing set up with an older dream on mine, you will recognize it from last week's episode. And just let the imaging system figure out what's what. You may need to specify some details, like if that building is a church or a bank A church in real life, of course, but in this case it will be the library where next week's fight scene will take place. Haha, spoilers! Anyway, once the system is done, you get a fully imersive environment, and just set the points of interest and actors. Now, using the camera tool, set the motion path, I put in just a point for a static point of view, and adjusting the focal length Wait, no, can we get some cloud cover? Too bright? No, the tower on the right looks better against the clouds. Ok, hold on..... Better? Perfect! So now we just hit Render, and lo and behold, the fabled city of Paris, as it probably looked back when. That's it for today's episode, be sure to like and subscribe, and we'll see you next week..... ..... On Making Movies On A Budget!

{"text": "It was June 1st, 2015 when they opened the sky above our home. The world remembers the day the Veck invasion started, but for me, it was also the day my daughter was born. As plasma scorched the heavens, my world was changing in a hospital delivery room. I was 39 years old, too old to be drafted, but when the world is at war, the Army can find something for you to do. Four years into the war I was considered an oddity, the casualty rate had been damn near 75, but I had been lucky so far. I had a bit of skill building and repairing networks and it had kept me out of combat. Hell, I even got to Skype my family now and then, they had made it back into the Midwest and were staying with my folks. I was always worried about our daughter Ally though, she never talked, just watched her videos and looked at her picture books. The doctors said it had something to do with the radiation that the Veck's used in their propulsion systems, it was affecting children across the globe. Developmental disorders and birth defects were very common, but one doctor in particular was hopeful as she had escaped the front early on. I was in the basement of what had once been a strip club trying to keep communications up for my regiment when the second wave hit Atlanta. They tore a wormhole open half a mile wide, and soldiers from H. R. Giger's nightmares poured out. The United Nation troops that I was assigned to fought tooth and nail, hand to hand combat in some places when the shock troops poured into the green zone. I was going to die in the heat and humidity of Atlanta 850 miles from where I was born. As they burst through the ground floor windows I could hear the mixed gunfire of my troops, I went about the task of setting the explosives. I was under strict and direct orders to not allow our encryption software to fall into the hands of the enemy. I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if I was standing inside it, but at least I could do this final task. Sweat poured down my face as I went about my grim final actions and I could hear the unearthly screams of the metal and flesh beasts as they tore apart my friends. The temperature in the storeroom where I had spent the last six months suddenly dropped, I frantically spun around from attaching the last of the cables to the C4 to come face to face with a small teenage girl whose green eyes pierced my soul. At that moment the fortified doors burst open, and half a dozen steel demons burst forth hellbent on destruction. As I stood I grabbed the detonator and whispered, \"God forgive me\" and slammed on button, but nothing happened. The girl looked up to me and in a hauntingly beautiful voice she sang, \"Do you want to build a snowman?\" We had been seen and the beasts were coming for us, I frantically pushed the button again and again, but once again, nothing. The girl turned and for the first time I saw what she was holding, it looked like a flashlight, but when she thumbed the side of it, a very distinctive humming came from and a beam of solid blue light emanated from it. \"Come on let's go and play!\" her melodic voice continued and she leaped into battle. It was a slaughter, she moved faster then I could follow, but before she could finish \"I never see you anymore, come out the door, it's like you've gone away.\" There was nothing but a pile of severed limbs and heads and she was gone out the smashed in doorway. In shock, I looked down and found out why I was still alive, I hadn't connected the last wire. I grabbed my sidearm and rushed up the stairs, they were slick with melting snow. As my vision adjusted to the blinding light, I had a hard time understanding what I was seeing. The Veck were being pushed back, but not by tanks and jets. A serpent dragon that I could have sworn was tattooed on the back of a Japanese soldier I had lost 3 days of desert to a few weeks ago was fighting alongside what could have only been a 12 foot tall and feral form of Winnie the Pooh. Harry Potter and Wolverine were back to back holding off what had to be a dozen Veck. My Little Pony characters were feasting on the flesh of both man and beast like some rainbow colored Mares Of Diomedes. My body and mind decided in unison that they had enough, and I woke up 8 days later in a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. Within hours of awaking, I was being debriefed by a Brigadier-General and his staff who were very interested in my accounts of what was to be known as the first battle of \"The Children's Crusade.\" After being grilled for 4 hours on my experiences in Atlanta there was a knock on the door, and a nurse whispered \"his family is here.\" I have never seen so much brass move that quickly and they ushered in my wife and daughter. My wife wept and told me how great it was to see me again, even if it was in a hospital and she sat my Ally at the foot of my bed. She clutched a 30 year old Princess Leia figure that my folks must have dug out of my childhood closet, looked at me with her big green eyes, and for the first time spoke. \"Do you want to build a snowman?\" It got very quiet, and the July heat was drained from the room.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 29, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "There were always two. Some believe there was one, others believe there were three, four or even 100, but it was always only two. Omniscience and Omnipotence.

I will use this to monitor all activity, and slowly create systems to suppress anyone who seems to know what I am trying to do.

{"text": "Hank passed the food through the hatch, watching the prisoner kneel and take the serving tray, heavy and unweildy as it was. Mr. Greenwick, for all his stoicism, looked haggard today - his last day, Hank corrected himself. The looming prospect of death finally caught up to the curt, proper man, as it always did even with the toughest death row folk, leaving a husk in his place. Honestly, he never enjoyed seeing them like that. The federal prison system attracted a lot of psychopaths that got off on human suffering, there was no denying the bitter truth about the employees, and Hank felt it was his duty to undo at least some damage those people were causing. The inmates were going to die anyway, and they weren't hired to dole out revenge. To him, working with the death row inmates was something akin to the military service he so dearly missed. Something that held at least a tiny grain of ethical purpose. Mr. Greenwick never caused him trouble, and he found himself approaching the day of the man's execution with actual dread. It was ironic in its own way, when Hank thought about it loud and clear as he did then - every day, thousands of people die, but it's never a concern. Perhaps because they die unpredictably and suddenly, snuffed in an instant of imperceptible chance. But when a man's death becomes scheduled and inevitable, like Mr. Greenwick's upcoming rendezvous with a deadly chemical cocktail, well, then death becomes terrifying and sad. \"That's nice,\" the guard remarked, watching the inmate solemnly remove the plastic covers from each small container on the tray. \"That's very nice, Mr. Greenwick.\" The death row inmate smiled and grabbed a napkin, wiping his hands clean before snatching a warm croissant out of one of the trays. \"It's actually fantastic, Hank,\" the prisoner's dried-out, gaunt face melted into an uncharacteristic expression of fondness and pleasure. He shook the croissant in the air. \"Real bread! I missed it so much. Nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked dough, don't you agree? Listen - it crinkles if you squeeze it!\" As he talked and basically rubbed the pastry to his cheek, the guard grabbed a chair that stood at the opposite wall, pulled it up to the cell's door. Sat, observing the prisoner and his ritualistic handling of each of the dishes. \"Mind my company, Mr. Greenwick?\" \"No, not at all. I'm flattered, in fact.\" \"So, what have you got?\" \"Right! \" , the inmate sniffed and put a finger to his mouth, lapsing for a moment in deep thought. \"So, I requested some goulash, it's here, in this bowl - so, so fragrant, can you smell those sweet peppers? Then here, here we have a piece of smoked eel, a little bed of rice for it, of course...\" He pointed to another plastic plate. \"Oh and this! Famous Chinese dish, chicken feet in black bean sauce. Positively spicy and drippy. Some cous-cous..... And a taco, you can't go wrong with that.\" \"Seems like you've got the whole world in your tray,\" Hank remarked amicably. Carl Greenwick's spork dipped into the goulash. He sampled, savored, smacking his lips with closed eyes, and only then looked back at the guard. \"Oh yes. These are the dishes from my favorite cities. A token to take in the afterlife, in case it actually exists,\" For a moment, Mr. Greenwick's glance became sharp once again, and Hank tensed, catching up to the meaning of the prisoner's quip. His shoulders slumped when he drew the connection. Of course. Budapest. Lyon. Kioto. Zhengzhou. Abu Dhabi. Mexico. The guard shifted in place, once again facing the discomfort of connecting the polite, calculated gentleness of a person he curated for the last four years to the clinical and documented knowledge of this man outside the prison walls. The conversation hitched, like a record needle skipping on a faulty grove in the disc, and Greenwick studied Hank intently, only the noodles from the chicken feet slurping softly as the inmate consumed them. Hank shook his unease off. What was done, was done. The price was about to be paid. \"So, that's what you had..... before, when you were..... you know?\" \"A man of my age is allowed some nostalgia, I think,\" Greenwick smiled thinly. Hank nodded, as if he understood what the man was talking about. His prisoner broke a piece of eel off, shoving it into his mouth with a desperate, wholesome voracity. \"Good food is essential. I used to have really nice dinners before the kill. A hearty, satisfying meal weighs you down just so. There's none of that hungry, dangerous hurry that might spoil things, no twitchiness in your finger as it lays down on the trigger. You even breathe contently, which, as you can guess, Hank, is really important,\" Mr. Greenwick continued. His pale eyes lit up with the recollection. \"And your memories aren't of blood, and screams and people running, about slinking down the fire-escape thinking that everybody's eyes are on you..... You just remember that, that you had a pretty good time. Well. Sorry. Look at me ramble before I pass away, eh?\" Hank gulped. \"It's okay, Mr. Greenwick, we talked about it in quite some detail before. But I still don't- you don't seem like you're particularly sorry..... are you not?\" The inmate took his time to chew, savored the bits of croissant crust off his fingers. Well, he wasn't. Of course not. One thing is to make bad choices, take drugs, cut off your elderly mother's head while riding the wave of a particularly shitty trip. One thing is to get talked into a poorly thought-out heist and shoot two cops in panic. One thing is giving into perverted primal urges and ravage a 10-year-old girl, then panickedly kill her to cover the tracks. Quite another was to have a life-long system, an ideology, and a purpose. A dead-set course of action, premeditated and flawlessly executed for reasons more solid than hand-wrought steel. Regret, in Carl Greenwick's mind, stemmed from dissatisfaction, be it dissatisfaction with choice, outcome or consequence. In his case, though, he was satisfied. Totally. There was no flaw in neither his concepts or execution. His message was delivered and heard. \"No, Hank. I'm not. Those were not crimes of passion. Those were people I wanted dead, and eh..... making them dead, after all these years, I believe was the right choice.\" \"Many think such of you now.\" Mr. Greenwick shrugged. Beneath the spacious orange jumpsuit he looked so unassuming and small - Hank still couldn't believe him to be the person on FBI's \"Most Wanted\" list for eight whole years. It was chilling, and he caught himself truely feeling sorry that today it will all end. He'll end up with six murder-rapists and psychotic serial-killer wannabes, that lacked Mr. Greenwick's icy calm and tact, and his articulation, to boot. But even more importantly than losing an adequate inmate..... Beneath those words, he knew that Carl Greenwick was afraid to die. Still wasn't ready for it. Those who didn't fear death, usually killed themselves, not embarked on a 8-year trip around the globe to hide and shake the impending doom off. It was always sobering to see men like that to succumb to basic human biology. He will face the needle alone. On the needle's terms. No comfort before oblivion. \"It is their right. After all, I...,\" Greenwick paused, the spork hovering over the cous-cous. \"I..... I never deluded myself into thinking that I was above encountering consequences for my actions. I never got peace - but then, I wasn't exactly looking for it.\" \"It's admirable, Mr. Greenwick,\" Hank reassured. \"Welcome to the fanclub, Hank,\" the inmate chuckled, and Hank joined in, his laughter revebrating through the corridor. The fan-mail that Carl received to this day, was a source of low-key fun for both the inmate and the guard. The administration screened the prisoner's outgoing mail, not big on letting him write anything too instigating to the already unhinged \"followers,\" but the incoming mail was largely left uncensored - and thus, the most hilarious. There were other letters, too. Those which brought Mr. Greenwick no joy, but had instead cast a shadow over his face, shut him out, turned him into his unfeeling, murderous, focused doppelganger. Letters that he never opened - ones that started with a \"Dear son...,\" or \"I'm still missing you, Carl.\" Mr. Greenwick tilted the plate with the chicken feet to his lips, lapping up the last of the sauce. Put it down, cleaned his face - it had finally assumed that half-relaxed, determined look many of the death-row inmates were known to get on their final hours. Hank knew it wouldn't stay such for long. Other procedures - some humiliating, but even then, implemented to preserve the dignity of the condemned - awaited Carl Greenwick, and further down the road, there would be pain, terror and agony, before the final flutterings of the heart would still to peace. Ha, peace. \"I'm done, Frank,\" he lightly pushed the tray back to the hatch. Hank stood up and collected it. The bowls, containers and utensils were in perfect order. He imagined Greenwicks's sniper rifle parts to be in same pristine shape and practicality of position. No mess, no trouble. A last gesture of appreciation. No resignation, Hank was sure, for that hateful, dark edge never went away, but it wasn't like Mr. Greenwick had any way to show his gratitude in such an environment. Hank did his job well. There was no unnecessary suffering, and in return, he received a modicum of restraint. Not peace. Contentment. Perhaps, the greatest balance two men could achieve when separated by bars, by struggling altruism and buried bloodlust. \"That you are, Mr. Greenwick.\" As Hank walked away, the tray in his hands, he could feel Mr. Greenwick's mercury-tinged gaze follow him, boring into his back..... but for the first time, he didn't feel like a target. For some reason, that was the saddest thing.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 32, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "I just sat there, Indian style, well actually, I guess Native American style, on the beautiful white floor. The reflection of the overhead lights are bouncing off the tile. I thought the room was set very nicely, very feng shui. There was a natural flow from my bed frame, which was made out of a rusted metal which shows that it has withstood the adversity of moisture in the air and is not giving up just yet, to the work space that has been allotted to me, which is ample, that is set to the tone of a pale brown wood paneling which is chipping away in a beautiful pattern, all the way to the toilet and sink combination, which is surprisingly water efficient and makes using the facilities a much shorter process and allows me some time to think. I felt at peace with my situation. Every once in a while someone comes in to check on me. The conversation doesn't usually last very long, but the notion of checking on me is helpful. It makes me smile from time to time. I may be alone, but I'm not lonely. It does sometimes get difficult to move around in here because the space is a little cramped, but the more I think about it, it just means that I have become familiar with my living area and I know every square inch of this place. There aren't any surprises. I was put in here by a judge and jury a few weeks back. I had seen a homeless man on the ground and he appeared to be shivering. When I got a little bit closer, I saw that he was actually bleeding. He had a laceration in his stomach and was bleeding pretty bad. He was moaning and wailing. I took off my overcoat and wrapped it around him and asked him to try to remain calm and that everything will be alright. I stopped the bleeding by taking off my scarf and applying pressure on the wound. I yelled for help and by the time the police got there with paramedics, the homeless man was unconscious. He still had a pulse, but it was fading. I told the police what happened and they instantly threw me into a police car. I was arrested for attempted murder because they said there was no plausible reason for a total stranger to help a bum. They said I sounded insane when I wanted to help my fellow man and that I thought he could have survived. The trial showed the public that I slashed this man and tried to kill him, that the homeless man was the one calling for help, that I was only trying to smother the wound because I was trying to rip it open further and my scarf got in the way, and that he was wearing my overcoat so nobody would see a dead body, only a bum wrapped in a coat that he probably stole in order to keep warm on a cold December Monday. During the trial, I was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge ordered me to be sent to an asylum and take prescription medication to level myself out, although he has no faith in modern science and thinks that all pills are sugar pills to induce a placebo effect, an effect that unfortunately, according to him, was not sufficiently backed by scientific research. I'm just thankful that I wasn't sent to prison and that I won't have to find out if the rumors of how terrible prison food is are true. At least there's that. So I just sit here in this asylum and think about what kind of a position I'm in. After all, things could be a lot worse. That homeless man could have died in transit to the hospital. They said that it wasn't saving a man from being murdered; they said I failed in attempting the murder. I disagree, and I think that is why I'm here. In this world in this time, it is considered insane to think that a man survived a murder rather than thinking the murderer couldn't even finish the job.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 33, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "The nurse pulled out the needle and stuck band aid on the small hole. \"There you go Mr. Olson. You are all set. Make sure to set up an appointment in about a year with the receptionist.\" I gave a small smile. \"I have to come back so soon?\" She smiled. \"Only to check up on you and give you your immunizations.\" She grabbed her folder and walked out the door. I slipped on my jacket and walked out into the hall down to the receptionists window. \"I've already got you set for January 21st, 2044 Mr. Oslon.

I had been alive since 1996, which makes me 48. But I don't look a day over 24. When they discovered the cure to death in 2019, I was one of the first to volunteer. I never really wanted to have kids, and never had had a huge sex drive, even in my teenage years. I never really talked about it, as many people still protested regularly over the legality of it. It wasn't exactly something simple to comprehend, especially for older people who had lived in a world filled with death. But for me it had become a fact of life, and I had never looked back. Would I rather have balls and a dick, or a young body forever. Well, I guess for me it was an obvious choice. Most of my none immortal friends either went away, rejected me, or moved on with their lives and had kids. The only ones left I felt I could relate to where those like me. I walked into the bar to see Joey, Teressa, Emily, and Mike in a booth. \"Look who's back from the doctors!\" Mike howled. \"They didn't take your balls again did they?\" He quietly asked. \"You seem to be more interested in my balls than the doctor Mike.\" I grabbed the beer waiting for. \"Mike is just pissed cause his boss was out sick again.\" Teressa said. \"Yeah and its annoying as fuck. How the hell am I supposed to submit our budget report without her stamp of approval? Its just annoying as hell. Sinus infection my ass. I don't buy it.\" Joey grabbed Mike's beer \"Just like you won't ever buy the fucking tab you ass!\" We all laughed and took a drink as Mike tried to get his drink back. \"You know, have any of you ever gotten sick?\" I asked. Everyone looked around. \"Well I think I did a couple of times. But that was before the cure.\" Emily scratched her head. \"Yeah, I've only ever been tired, but not really ever sick.\" \"Why are you asking Chris? Did the doc have some bad news?\" I sipped from my drink. \"No, no its just that they keep giving me immunizations every year. If they are they are that effective, why not give them to everyone?\" Everyone sat in thought for a moment. \"Maybe they don't work with people who still have their reproductive organs?\" Joey stated, but I shook my head. \"See, I don't feel like that makes any sense. What could be in those immunizations that only people without those organs could take?\" The TV blared in the background talking about the top plays of the week. \"Did they ever tell you what they did with the organs?\" Suddenly the comfortable atmosphere slipped away, and Emily nervously drank from her bottle. \"What if..... what if they were using them..... ya know, somehow in the immunizations.\" We all stared at Joey as he spoke. \"I mean, I don't know about you guys but I wanted to know what was going to happen to my, well stuff. I saw a room on the way out of the clinic, with just shelfs filled with them. It looked like they were harvesting them.\" I swallowed hard. \"You don't think..... that they're like, using the reproductive cells, to keep us alive, or something, right?\" Mike asked quietly. The TV blasted out a commercial about a talking lizard. All of a sudden Mike laughed loudly and finished his beer. \"You fuckers get way to depressed over nothing. Like the hospitals are cultivating human cells to create immortal people. HA, you think they could keep a secret like that!?\" Everyone started laughing, as I scratched my band aid.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 35, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "The room glowed slightly from all the screens. Hundreds and hundreds of screens, some small, some bigger than others across every available wall surface. Apart from the light from the screens, it was dark. Electricity is expensive after all when reindeer power the generator. In the midst of the screens was a chair and a small desk, empty except for three telephones. In the chair sat a visibly disheveled man. Watching, always watching the thousands and thousands of screens. The man couldn't remember the last time he had slept. Ever since selling this mainframe to the US government he had been required to monitor it constantly. This was not the issue though, because he had monitored it since the beginning of time. The issue was that they demanded to know things they shouldn't. It taxed the old man. He was the keeper of secrets, the decider of good and bad. Not them. Not them. What the NSA didn't know was that the old man had made similar sales to other customers, each believing that they alone had purchased this amazing technology. The Chinese had bought his services first, then the Russians. It wasn't until trade deals began being sabotaged and national secrets began leaking that the Americans had finally made the purchase. Because the old man was the only one who could operate this system, each had no reason to believe that any other nation had access. A phone rang, and the old man answered. A look of concern flashed across his face before he slammed the phone down and looked at the floor. Who were they to ask such a thing? The old man thought for a moment, breaking from watching the screens for what seemed the first time in a thousand years.

'The Russians are launching their nukes.\" Then he had similar conversations with the other two phones. The old man smiled. An enormous weight lifted from his shoulders.

{"text": "Announcer Jeremy: Tonight, on The Grand Tour: James is attacked by a Compy. I take a casual off-road drive in a Land Rover. And Richard pees himself. Jeremy: Helloooo Hellooooo, thank you thank you, and welcome to the Grand Tour. Coming to you from Isla Meurta. James: I say doesn't that mean the Island of Death? Jeremy: Yes it does James, but don't think too much about it we've been in worse places. James: Like what, exactly? I saw an actual Dinosaur as we came in on the Engine Helicopter. Four feet and a giant gaping mouth. Hammond: Looked rather like Margaret Thatcher Jeremy: Thank you Richard. No that was a herbivore, and we like herbivores, they don't try to eat us. Richard: Wait hold on how do you know it was a herbivore? You are no expert on dinosaurs sir. In fact you are an expert on nothing. Why are we here? Jeremy: Hammond we are here because your lawyer called the Producers and informed them that you now own this park, and the Producers saw an opportunity. Richard: Wait hold on, I own this now? They didn't tell me that. Jeremy: No they were waiting to see if you got eaten first. James: May I just point out that while the dinosaur we saw when we first landed was in fact a Diplodocus and thus a herbivore, there are signs on this map I've just been handed by the Producers which clearly say Tyrannosaurus Rex pens and Velociraptor Field. These are not..... Jeremy: Yes yes, that's all well and good James, but nobody cares about what you're saying because it's boring. We have been given a challenge. We are to, in a word, survive. We will make our way from this welcome center, through the Raptor fields, past the T-Rex pen, and lastly finish the tour at the exit gates here at the ferry dock. And we will be doing so in these: Richard you'll be driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. James you shall be driving a 1988 Toyota Land Cruiser, and I shall be driving a 2001 Land Rover. Mine of course has more power, because I asked for the most powerful one. James: They all look hideous. Jeremy: Blame Hammond for that, he owns this place now this is his paint scheme. Richard: Wait you can't blame me for this I've just found out I own the place. And don't touch that, that looks expensive to fix. Announcer Jeremy: So we set off on our tour of the island. The Producers gave each of us a flare gun and a package of bear spray, along with a map. James wanted to lead the way but I quickly determined that he was going too slowly so I chose an opportune moment to surge ahead. James: Clarkson you pillock, we have no idea what's ahead of us, slow down! Richard: Yes slow down Jeremy, you might crash into my new park and if you do you're paying for the damages. Jeremy: Hammond if I crash into anything it will just be petrol in a few years so look on the bright side, you've got a future in OPEC! Announcer Jeremy: Everything was going smoothly under my direction when suddenly things took a turn for the worse. James:..... of course this entire park appears to be fabricated from plants and animals that evolved millions of years apart, and could never have existed the same time. That plant over to our right for example is from the Triassic era, while that small dinosaur up ahead would appear to have been from the Tithonian age..... Announcer Richard: James was then attacked by a large number of small dinosaurs. The Toyota was up to the task. James: Get away from me you little bast...... Jeremy: Everything ok back there James? I accidentally bumped a gate open a few minutes ago, I trust everything is progressing normally? James: Clarkson you cock, you've let some dinosaurs out into the wild and they've attacked my truck. My tires have been eaten by some sort of acid. Richard: What do you mean you bumped a gate open Jeremy? If you've damaged my park I'm going to have it taken from your pay. Announcer Jeremy: We progressed through the park, James with a new tire and horribly scarred paint job that actually improved the look of his Toyota. As we approached the Raptor portion of the journey Richard began to show signs of sluggishness. Jeremy: Something wrong with your Jeep Richard? You seem to be falling behind. Richard: No, no nothing wrong with the Jeep. I just keep feeling like we are being watched. James: Of course we're being watched there are cameras all over the place. Richard: No, I think there's something out there. Announcer Jeremy: Hammond was right. His natural instincts as a small animal that survived by sensing when hunters were tracking him were showing through. James: Come on Richard. Everything is behind a fence. Unless Jeremy has broken another gate. Jeremy: I merely grazed that one thank you very much. Richard: Grazed it? Going 50 MPH? Jeremy: Oh cheer up Hammond, look at all this magnificent land, all of it yours. Richard: Not after you get through with it, you're destroying it piece by piece. And what was that noise? Announcer James: That noise was in fact, a Raptor jumping onto the roof of Richards Jeep. James: Wow, what an excellent example of a Velociraptor. Flash it with your high beams Richard. Richard: Ahhhhhhhhhhh Jeremy: Hammond control yourself. The Producers wouldn't send us out here in the wild if they thought we could come to harm. Use your bear spray, I'm sure it will work. Richard: Ahhhh, the cap is broken, the cap is broken. Here we go, and ahhhhOhh god I've sprayed myself. I've sprayed myself. And peed myself if I'm honest. James: It's worked, the bear spray is driving the Raptor away! By Jove Hammond! Announcer Jeremy: Having survived the Raptors and the devious Compys, we now made our way into the dragons den of all lions dens. The Tyrannosaurus Rex pen. All of us were more than willing to proceed past this point in the tour but the Producers insisted. Jeremy:..... And so you see the Land Rover is simply superior to anything else on the road. Look at what we've been through so far. My Land Rover has managed to suffer nothing but a few dents in the bumper. Hammond's Jeep is a mess of urine feces and bear spray, which I'm sure will take forever to clean and the roof is barely holding up. James Land Cruiser is of course the indestructible truck but even it could not escape this tour unscathed. Richard: Jeremy you've gone off the road. Jeremy you're on the wrong path. Jeremy: That's ok, my Land Rover can handle anything. I know what I'm doing, I'm going to race you both to the dock. James: You win Jeremy, come back please. You're headed into the T-Rex pen itself. It's marked off limits. Jeremy: No no, I will have none of your nonsense James May. They could not have a fully grown T-Rex on this island, it's too small. It would starve. My Land Rover can out race anything else on this island, including you're two pitiful excuses for 4x4s. Announcer Richard: And with that we shut up and let him go. We could always find a new co-host. Chris Evans isn't doing anything. Jeremy: I may have erred when I said they couldn't have a full grown T-Rex on this island. Because I am stuck right now in a ditch. A ditch that looks remarkably like a footprint. And I don't know if I can get out of it. Time to switch to sport mode. And now press the fiddly little button, and here we go....no no that didn't do it. I'll have to engage the Terrain Management system and switch it to MudRuts. There we go and..... hahah yes we are free! Britain is gloriously victorious once again! Announcer Jeremy: I shouldn't have been so happy. I might have been out of the ditch but my efforts to gain freedom had been noticed. Jeremy: Oh my god what is that? Must go faster. Land Rover don't fail me now! James: Jeremy scientists estimate that T-Rexs can only reach a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour! You can do it Clarkson! Announcer Richard: As we rounded the last bend to the docks we could see Jeremy in his Land Rover being chased by a T-Rex. Richard: It's almost got you Jeremy, turn hard right! James: Yes, lets see what turns better, a Land Rover or a T-Rex. Clarkson: Now is really not the time James! Announcer James: In fact it was. Clarkson's sharp turn was in fact the difference, and as we boarded the ferry, our cars full of mud and our own biowaste, we couldn't help but thank goodness that dinosaurs couldn't fly. Announcer Jeremy: And on that Bombshell, gooodnight! edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I saw the story right in front of me as soon as I saw the topic. Brilliant suggestion.

{"text": "Ever wake up and just know it's going to be one of those days? You know the kind, the one where you sleep through your alarm clock, the shower seemed to change to bipolar settings overnight (either Mordor hot or deep-space cold), you spill coffee on your freshly ironed work clothes and the dog used the kitchen floor as a latrine. It was one of those days. I couldn't find my keys, I was late to work and Bigglesworth had gotten out again. I don't know how he does it, he can't find his way out of a blanket let alone a house. I do, however, know why. He does it to mock me, why else would he meow outside the window and run away the second I see him? I never wanted a cat, but my last boyfriend thought an obligation would serve as a better anniversary present rather than a ring. But of course, I'm happy he didn't get me one of those, I suppose it should have been a sign. What kind of person buys their girlfriend a twelve year old cat from the pound for their fifth anniversary? Around the time I was pulling my burnt toast from the toaster, I got a call from work, asking where I was. At the time, I worked at a restaurant as a cocktail waitress. I was late for my evening shift and Manager Nicholas Blakeslee (of whom we called Dickless Flakeslee behind his back) was more than upset about being an hour late. I know, I know, sleeping in and missing the 5pm deadline for work is hardly piteous, but like I said, it was one of those days. I cursed the charcoalized toast, tossed it, flipped off Bigglesworth who sat perched in the neighbor's yard, leaving a peanut sized present for my passive-aggressive-note-leaving-neighbor, Candace, and ran towards the bus stop. And would you believe it, it started raining. It was something from a comedy, I looked about, searching for hidden cameras, waiting for Ryan Seacrest to jump out of a bush and shove a microphone in my face. I missed the first bus, ignored Ol'Dickless's calls and waited in the rain. I wasn't sure how I was going to work in sopping wet clothes, but then again I didn't want to get my hopes up about that: judging by how the day was going, I wouldn't be surprised if my blouse spontaneously combusted. That's where you showed up. I didn't see where you came from, it seemed like you appeared at my side, umbrella out and an inviting smile on your face. You were on your way home from work. You wore a casual suit, a deep blue deepened by the weather, a white collared shirt, a tie the color of cotton candy and rain boots. Those stupid rain boots. That was the first thing I ever gave you shit for. Actually, if you remember, that was the first thing I said to you. \" Rain boots are kind of an odd accessory to you outfit. \" Your laugh matched your easy smile, you nodded your head and conceded, then went on to ask how my feet were getting along knowing full well my black flats housed their own oceanic microcosm. That was the first time we met, we both skipped the next bus and haven't looked back. I look back on that day and thank God for losing my keys, for sleeping it and even for that poop factory Bigglesworth. I love you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 41, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "How amusing. You bare your teeth at the small man, allowing the orange glow from your ember charred throat to spill into the cave, eyes and gold glinting alike in the semi-dark. Acrid plumes of smoke waft from your nostrils, the smell of death filling the air. Meat is best when you can still taste the lingering dread in the flesh. One of life's simple pleasures is the look of terror in eyes of a \"hero\" moments before you devour him, and it's been so very long since anyone has disturbed your slumber. This will be a delight. But the man looks..... bored!? \"Please, I don't have time for theatrics,\" the little man says. \"Do you have any idea how difficult it was to find you? The holo-maps for this planet are abysmal. It's a minor miracle humans ever made it out of the primitive age here.\" What under the glory of the five gods is he talking about? Holo-maps? Planets? Your patience is wearing thin. \"So here's the deal. The way I see it, you've been hibernating down here for what, three, four-thousand years? A lot has changed out there. A lot.\" He paces back and forth, idly kicking over small piles of gold, waving his hands in explanation. Coins skitter across the cavern floor. \"You wouldn't last two seconds out there, kid. Not two seconds.\" Kid? Did he just call you kid? You feel the rage bubbling up in your chest, frothing in the back of your throat. Raising yourself up to full height, you arch your neck and unleash your hellfire inferno on the pacing mortal who dared condescend your might. To your surprise, the flames wreathe around in him a perfect sphere, charring the cave wall behind him, but leaving him unscathed. \"Whewee, you're going to need to keep a lid on your temper if we're going to be partners, I am NOT doing couples therapy with a dragon again.\" Couples therapy? Wait, again? \"As I was saying, you've been couped up here for waaaay too long. Things have changed out there. Ten minutes outside and you'd be atom-locked and shipped off to a d-sector prison before you could say'charred cattle,' which, by the way, don't exist here any more, just protein-rich fungi herds. You have to go off-world now if you want a decent quarter-pounder with cheese. And don't even get me started on the pizza situation.\" Pizza? He must be insane. There is some dark magic at work here. \"That's where I come in. I have the technology, interpersonal skills, and schematics for every Snork intergallactic bank building from here to Sentauri.\" He taps the small metallic bracelet on his left wrist and the coin he tossed in with your treasure horde suddenly flies into the air, spinning to a blur. Another tap on his bracelet and multi-colored balls of light fill the cavern, slowly rotating around the spinning coin. \"That's where you come in,\" he says, as if the room had not just exploded in dizzying color, as if nothing had changed at all. \"What I need is an acquisition specialist. Someone who can sense treasure behind quantum-locked vault doors. And more importantly, can sense booby traps. This is something I believe you have a particular talent for. Oh, don't worry, I'll outfit you with all the necessary gear so you aren't instantly vaporized by some trigger happy Core police rookie. We can work out the details with regard to the profits later, but you can be sure there will be plenty to go around. For now, I'm just looking for a yes or no. What do you say?\" You look around once more at your cavern, now undulating in the multi-colored glow from the spheres orbiting the coin. Had you really been asleep for four-thousand years? Maybe a change would be good..... You slowly lower your head to the strange little wizard and say with a billow of smoke \"I'm in.\" \"Excellent!\" He taps his silver bracelet again and swirling, circular mass materializes on the wall behind him, pulsing an eerie green. \"By the way, quantum tunneling doesn't make you sick up, does it?\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 42, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "\" Well, I can't blame you, no matter how hard I try. And believe me, I did try, \" I said. Then I waited for a long, long time. \" I know. Can't blame you either. \" At this distance, it was predictable that our conversation would be slow and ponderous. No matter; the lagging would give us plenty of time to think about each word we said. I knew him. I had known him my entire life. He was me, but not quite. I still remember the baffled stargazing, how fascinated I was, we all were, when the pale blue dot became visible to the naked eye. At first, you'd need to squint really hard, preferably while standing far away from city lights. A few weeks later, all you had to do was look up late in the afternoon, while you were coming back from work, that is, if you were one of the people who stuck to old habits. I remember the incredulity we all felt when we were told that the new celestial body, ushered overnight into our solar system by a wave of radiation, was Earth. Not our Earth, but another one precisely like ours. They called the whole thing a wormhole. I don't know what that is, and didn't intend or pretend to. I also remember the panic and hysteria when we were told that the other Earth was headed straight towards us. For what it's worth, this seemed like the sort of thing we needed. Something that came literally out of nowhere and shook us out of our stupor. Something to worry about. Something universal, that nobody could even think of dismissing as just business as usual. But then what? We finally were wide awake, but what for? Of course, leave it to mankind to choose aggressive action as the way out of its predicament. We would pool our resources, every single nation in the world chipping in, with whatever they could muster, then we'd all build the greatest statement of mankind's spirit of self-preservation: the largest missile ever built. Something big enough to crack a planet in two. With luck, we'd just sort of drift through between the two halves. The more squeamish among us thought that was a very bad idea. The other Earth was dead silent. Their lights were out. As far as we could see, there was nobody home. But... what if? We puzzled it out. We discussed. Some of us raised their voices. Others raised their guns. In the end, most of us took votes. Do we nuke our way through? Is there anybody alive out there? If so, do we nuke our way through, anyway? While we were busy deciding, their lights went on. And with the lights, came their voices. Our own voices. The wormhole-thing they went through had killed their electronics and their power sources. They pointed their telescopes toward us but, just like ourselves, they'd become used to sharing information through electronic means. Most had no way of even knowing what had just happened to their planet. When their radios, phones and televisions started working again, they were greeted by disturbing news. The growing blue dot in the sky at night was a copy of their planet. It was headed their way. It was debating whether or not to kill them. \" We talked it through, you know. The guys in your side probably did the math too. Seems like your Earth is going to plunge into the sun in a few years. In fact, I heard your orbit is too lopsided or something, so if we didn't crash and burn, you guys should have one hell of a suntan by the end of the year, anyway. \" I thought about that for a long time. What did the other guy, that other me, think of this? I kind of felt bad laying this out for him. Then he answered. \" I know. There's a flip side to that coin, though. \" He stopped, as if waiting for me to ask. In fact, I'm sure that's what he was doing. I'd have done it. When he remembered how far away I was, he went on. \" If you guys manage to split us in half, there's no telling what our planet's, uh, corpse is going to do to your orbit. I heard that on TV yesterday. They were trying to assure us you guys wouldn't open fire. Call me - or yourself, I guess - a pessimist, but I took that as meaning both our planets are as good as dead. We're your Nibiru. \" I could feel him, who knows how many miles away, also thinking if he'd hurt my feelings or something. As our planets grew closer together, we had reached the consensus that we were the same people, living in the same planet, in another reality indeterminably similar to our own. A few days ago, the other Earth seemed as big as the moon. The day before yesterday, it was at least six times bigger. The sunlight reflected from their oceans was a breathtaking sight. I had to remind myself it was late in the evening, even though there was a patch of sunrise in the sky. It was a beautiful, terrifying blue hour, an ominous presence like that of a god, quietly floating, always watching, coming ever closer. Eventually, what had only been observation and radio waves became gravity. Then came the flooding, the earthquakes, raging winds and tidal waves. It was as if the Earth itself was coming to terms with its own eventual death. Like we were all still trying to. Then this evening, it seemed like some trickster god had placed a giant mirror over our heads. I couldn't tell you how much bigger than the moon the other Earth was. It was no longer the oppressing, hauntingly beautiful presence in the night sky. It was the sky itself. I could see landmasses, oceans, great lakes and mountain ranges. I could name at least a dozen countries, and see their lights coming ever closer. \" When we came through, we left the moon behind. I don't think you can quite understand this, but I really, really missed it. You don't know how weird it is when your whole world blacks out, and you don't even have the moon at night. It's very lonely. \" I didn't know what to say to that. I had known loneliness. He had, too, of course. But missing the moon seemed like the sort of feeling no human being could ever be prepared for. \" Don't feel too bad for me, though. A few days ago we went right by your moon. For a few nights, we came really close, much closer than we've ever been to our own. I don't think you guys ever had such a beautiful night sky out there. So thanks for that, lending us your moon. \" \" Don't mention it. \" What else should I say? I had thought of last words for all sorts of situations. If I died live on television after saving a school bus full of children, if I jumped in front of a bullet to save the President, if I died on a hospital bed surrounded by family, I would know just the right thing to say, the right look to have in my face. I know that. I had spent enough time wondering about death and its thousand faces. But this? How to say goodbye to myself in anticipation of a planetary collision? \" I think I'm going outside, \" I said. \" I think I'll wait outside, \" he said. We had said our nearly identical last goodbyes at almost the same time. I went outside. The ground was faintly shaking. I lay down on the grass and looked straight up at the other Earth. I should be afraid. But I'm not. Not anymore. I can feel my stomach fluttering, and my limbs seem lighter, somehow. Maybe it's gravity. Whatever it is, I feel fine. I take one last moment to observe as the lights of some indeterminate city approach fast. Then I close my eyes and take a deep breath.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 43, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "It had been a little over 7 hours since the lander touched down on Martian soil. 7 hours ago, half the world watched as we, the pioneers of a new age of space exploration, entered Martian orbit and slowly began preparations to touch down. The moment the gear hit the dirt, celebrations broke out everywhere on Earth. Actually, I suppose they wouldn't have celebrated until a few minutes after we touched down due to the signal delay. Oh well, close enough. Now, things are pretty damn quiet here in Acidalia Planitia. But now the celebrations were over. We'd spent months getting here, years training, and taxpayers had given millions of their hard earned dollars to this project. It was time to get down to business. We'd spent the last few hours setting up gear here, including our habitation, complete with all the basic comforts of Earth: breathable air, water, and atmospheric pressure. Also, space food, but that's nothing to write home about. We had just finished setting up the rovers and other toys. We were understandably quite tired of building stuff, so we decided to go for a rip about in the rovers; for \"testing\" purposes, of course. It was me and Winters in the lead rover, and Commander Smith, a stern but effective leader and career airwoman, and Richthofen, the German, in the utility rover. I, of course, had dibs on the lead rover - had since take off. We decided to head a little north of the landing site, explore the plain a little. Acidalia Planitia was an ideal landing site, very flat and very easy to set up camp in. Perfect for a first test of our Mars exploration technologies. As we drove merrily along, Winters, the flight engineer, spotted something in the distance. \"Mike, you see that? Up ahead, about half a click...\" \"Yeah yeah, Winters, save me the damned analysis. Commander, you have eyes on this?\" \"Affirmative. Let's get a closer look. Dismount here,\" the Commander radioed. The rovers skidded to a halt. \"What could this be, out here? Supposed to be flat for miles,\" remarked Richthofen. \"Well, it certainly ain't a fuckin' tree, Richthofen,\" I shot back. \"Easy there, Johnny Carson,\" the Commander replied sternly, as we came within a few feet of the object. As we studied the mysterious anomaly, each of us grew dead quiet. \"It's a flag,\" Winters said, finally breaking the eerie silence. \"And certainly not one of ours,\" began the Commander. The tattered Soviet banner flew defiantly in front of the astronauts, as if taunting them for being so late to the party. It was riddled with holes, the once vibrant, blood red colour was no bleached, and the hammer and sickle were now barely visible, but it was still a damn fine looking flag. \"Mike, photograph this. Richthofen, Winters, you two have a look around the perimeter. I have to report this to Control.\" \"Uh..... Houston, we have a problem. You know those little green men you were worried about? Yeah, turns out they're Russians,\" I said snakily. \"Commander, you trying to give those guys a heart attack?\" \"Shut up and shoot photos, Mike,\" ordered the Commander. I started snapping pictures of the flag, of the site, and the soil around it. Standard procedure. May or may not have thrown in a selfie with the flag for good measure, because fuck it. What're they gon na do, fire me? In space? Nah, after months spent in a tin can, I was ready to have a little fun. I was just tucking the camera back into the rover when Winters' voice called out. \"Commander! Might want to have a look at this!\" We walked over to where Winters and Richthofen were standing. Strewn around them was what appeared to be aircraft debris, most of it covered with a few inches of soil, with only the horribly warped edges protruding. \"Look here, Commander. Got a red star on it, I think. Russian, no doubt about it,\" observed Winters. Richthofen was studying a rather large piece of metal. His pale, stormy blue eyes were highly inquisitive, his gaze deep. He was observing the debris with Teutonic efficiency. \"When my father worked for the Soviet space program..... before the wall fell..... he worked on pieces just like this. I remember him bringing small pieces home, tinkering with them, showing them to me and my sister. These are Soviet rocket parts. I have no doubt.\" Winters was also studying the pieces. \"There's junk just like this all over the place. Too much to just be left behind space junk. I think, based on the state of some of these pieces,\" he paused to pick up a rather large steel plate, marked with another red star, \"that there was an explosion of some kind. See here..... badly warped from the inside. Based on the shape, I'd say this came from a piece of the booster from the lander.\" \"Collect some of this junk and load it into the rovers. We need to bring some to the Hab for further analysis,\" ordered the Commander. I'll spare you the details of this rather boring interlude. Long story short, we picked up a nice assortment of crap from the dirt, loaded into the rover, and left that ugly flag flying. Commanders' insistence. Something about \"honouring our brothers who came before us.\" Eh, I hate communism as much as the next guy, but if I got blown up a million miles away from Earth, I'd want to be remembered to. When we got back, we suited down, had some food, and generally chilled out until the commander decided to hold court. \"I just got off the radio with NASA,\" began the Commander. \"Told them what we found. As per NASA rules, this all goes public in 48 hours. Russians don't seem to know anything.\" \"Bullshit,\" I said. \"Think about it, Young. The Russians would have told us if they knew about this. They would have known we would find it, so there would be no use in hiding it.\" \"The Soviets, they have many secrets,\" stated Richthofen, in a solemn voice, \"that died with them.\" \"Well, I've been thinking,\" said Winters. \"And I for one think this all makes perfect sense.\" \"Oh? Do tell,\" prompted the Commander. \"Well, you all know of Yuri Gagarin, I presume?\" The room nodded affirmatively. \"Yes, well, when he went up for the first ever human spaceflight, no one except the government and the Soviet space agency knew about it until after he took off, floated around in space a bit, and landed safely. The Soviets didn't want the U.S. to know how close they were to winning the Space Race in case shit hit the fan. Only after it was a success did they make it public. Better for propaganda, that way.\" \"And for scaring the living shit out of the U.S.\" I cut in. \"Precisely.\" The Commander looked puzzled. \"So, what you're saying is, the Soviets won the Space Race. Made it to Mars, the whole thing. But when it came time to go home, everything went wrong.\" \"So to save face, they covered up the entire project. But, why? They still won the damn Space Race,\" I chimed in, as thoroughly puzzled as everyone else. \"Perhaps,\" began Richthofen, \"they thought they could try again. Get it right, this time. But then, the Americans put a man on the moon, and they didn't want to bother..... how do you say it? To \"one-up\" the United States. Probably took the technology and used it for the ICBM program instead.\" \"I'm just amazed this never came out, even twenty-five years after the collapse,\" the Commander said thoughtfully. \"You'd be surprised,\" began Richthofen. \"They could make people disappear in the night, never to be seen again. I doubt they'd've had any trouble burning a few documents and swearing some scientists to secrecy.\" The Hab grew eerily silent as we all considered the gravity of our discovery. This could literally rewrite the history of human space travel. It was sobering. Ever the sarcastic joker, however, I just had to have the last laugh, to lighten up the now very somber mood in the Hab. \"And here I was thinking I'd get a statue here one day. Damn, now all I'll get is a shitty government building or something named after me. I can see it now: The Michael B. Young Mars Department of Public Sanitation Building. Quite the ring to it, no?\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 45, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "It was cold, dark, dreary. A perfect day to depart in a foul spirit, if there ever was one. The rain endlessly pattered against the glass, spilling streams of rain down onto the windowsill underneath it, flooding it, coating the very bottom of the window in a seemingly endless river of water. This weather was normal to where Smith lived, the endless rain and the damp spirits seemed to come naturally to the harbour town on the last stretch of winter when it was still cold enough to constitute a good jacket, however warm enough that it no longer snowed, and instead rained in the place of the flurries. It would rain all today, or atleast that's what the weather network woman had said over the television, it would rain until nightfall, and then break away to a lovely spring morning, one of the first with temperatures above freezing. Smith had called in sick today, telling his boss that he did not feel well enough to leave his bedside. While his boss was a bit of an ass on most ocassions, today, on the day of his death, he understood. Fate? his mind inquired, and with a short shake of his head, he dismissed it. No, the devil. The burden of all his problems in the last ten years running, the looming shadow which sulked at the end of his bedside, the greedy hand coming to snatch away his soul. The Usurper, The First Demon, Lucifer, The Fallen Angel. So many names for one man, one concept of all evil embodied, yet he was real, he was the one that on this day, ten years ago, struck a bet with Smith, making him an offer he could not refuse. Was it wealth? No. Was it women? No. Was it power? No Was it talent? Unfortunately, yes. Smith had struck a deal, in the days of soul searching, that he would give up his soul in ten years, in return for the ability to be artistically-talented to the point that a picture would make a god weep or reconsider his actions. He was granted this, the ability to draw, to paint, to sketch and to colour things beyond imaginable, to make things so beautiful that he, himself, could only weep. Yet, the deal itself was that he was to become the best artist, not that anyone would recognise him as this. Once he obtained this talent, the moment he tried to show someone, to prove to them that he was the most amazing artist in the world, the person's mind saw it differently. Not that they said it was bad, they simply showed no interest in it, as if it was magically blocked from their vision, as if it was nothing and would be nothing in their mind, no matter how beautiful he had made the picture. At first, this infuriated him, it made him break and tear up his pictures. Hundreds and hundreds that he had sketched and created did he tear and destroy, yet eventually, he learned to live with it. In his flat, his one-bedroom, one-bath, flat did he cover the place in paintings. Paintings that he had created, magical, beautiful paintings beyond what even could be described in script. He painted and drew when he came home until the morning broke, only to go to do the same thing again. His hand never wavered, and he could draw from cartoon to realistic, the very print that he made on a page seemed refined, perfected, alluring. He showed no sign of being anything less then perfect, and after four years did he learn to understand that, and at five, did he eventually come to terms with it. \"Knock knock.\" It wasn't actually the sound, instead a voice that emanated from his doorway to his bedroom. He didn't bother to look, for he knew it to be the devil, and instead checked the time. Exactly 3'oclock, on the dot, the exact same time he made the deal those ten years ago. \"I'm always on time, before you ask.\" The devil reminded, a thin smile crossing over his pale-white lips. \"Of course you aren't. To say someone would be late to their own death would be preposterous.\" Smith retorted, raising a brow from the devil. \"You intend to kill me?\" The devil remarked, crossing his hands across his chest. \"No, but I'm not going to die if you're not here.\" Smith cracked back, finally turning his gaze onto the tuxedo-wearing, pale man with those round black dots for eyes and that uncanny, almost polluted, oil-slick back hair. \"Ah, well I suppose that is true.\" The devil said, now that he had caught Smith's attention, and flashed him a very car salesman-esque smile, drawing a dull eyeroll from Smith. He had grown tired of the aspect of the devil's attitude, he had nothing to fear in his last moments, so acting so carelessly was simply in his nature to do so. Silence, tense silence, passed for a few moments, the devil remaining silent as he looked around, a bit taken aback by the amount of pictures. \"Most people who end up like this usually destroy the works they do. The few who haven't ended up being revelled as some of the best, you know that right?\" The devil asked aloud to Smithy, a certain one, a depiction of a lady clad in fire, almost made up of it, caught his curious eye. \"How so? You made it so that nobody notices my work, that nobody will ever grow to acknowledge that it existed in the first place.\" Smith barked back, a bit irritated, and rightfully so. The wound from what the devil had done to him still having not closed even after six years of acceptance. \"Once you're gone from this plane of existence, I no longer have control over what fate dictates, meaning that people will grow to notice your works, and they will fall in love. You could go down as the greatest artist in history, for all I know.\" The devil shrugged, slowly making his way towards Smith's bed, only to stop at the footrest. \"Does that make you feel any better?\" He inquired, looming over Smith. \"No, not really. They're your creations, after all, my body and mind was a vessel, it used your talent.\" The devil pondered that, before gleaming a sly grin, \"Now, nobody will know that, will they?\" Smith shrugged, rolling over in his bed, ignoring the devil as if it was an unwanted guest. \"I suppose.\" The devil's hand came to rest on Smith's back, the very touch feeling as if he had walked, bareback, out into a blizzard, the sense of pure burning, yet a cold burning, running through his body, chilling him to the bone. \"Now Smith, it's about time we go. Would you like for this to be a natural death, a suicide, or a homicide?\" The devil surely was being awfully kind for a man on his deathbed. \"Natural death, heart attack.\" The devil released his hand from Smith's back, his heart beginning to race, pacing against his chest, burning his eyes, a feeling of overwhelming sickness running rampart in his head. This certainly wasn't a heart attack, instead, Smith knew it to be the devil's own interpretation of it. \"Did you have fun, Smith?\" The devil asked once Smith was nearly falling away into death's cold embrace, a perplexed smile crossing over Smith's face, rousing a bit of a smile from the devil himself. \" Of course I did, and perhaps I will enjoy death as much as I did life. \"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 46, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "We hadn't announced anything, but we were losing. Badly. People could tell as more and more worlds were listed as \"temporarily unavailable due to background radiation\" at the wormhole stations. Technically not a lie. The Swarm's drones were mildly radioactive, synthesizing more mundane resources into the unnatural \"foods\" that allowed them to survive the vacuum of space, travel faster than light to new systems, rend our defense ships with atom-thin clawblades, and self-destruct with a fission reaction powerful enough to destroy small planetoids. The evacuations had been successful beyond our wildest hopes - almost 50 of sapients evacuated - but now we had another problem. The Swarm was in range of our core worlds. It was unthinkable, but the hub of galactic civilization itself, the World-City, was at risk. But life goes on, at least until it doesn't, and we were hosting the Human delegation as a part of the interview process to join the galactic community. There'd been a lot of hesitance. A lot of sapients joked that they were scarier than the Swarm. A hive mind they could understand, but an unconscious parasitic relationship with microorganisms was just weird. And of what we'd learned of their culture, they had a lengthy history of not just war but glorification of it. That they entertained their offspring with stories of deadly combat before they were trusted with knowledge of reproduction. Their ability to survive extreme cold and hot without temperature support apparatus was unprecedented. And the way they consumed nutrients was disgusting and barbaric, not to mention the way their historian said they used to obtain them - stalking sentients to the point of exhaustion, then setting them on fire and ripping them apart with their nutrient consumption oriface. I disagreed, though. I'd seen what the Swarm could do firsthand. We were giving them a tour of our technological capabilities, finishing up with a tour of our satellite ship manufacturing facility. It was a hail-mary. They were the fourth species we'd interviewed, with the promise of upliftment to any species who had a strategy for defeating the Swarm. The VI in control of the shuttle announced we'd be using a lightspeed accelerator to cut the time of our journey to just four seconds, and to make sure you were seated or holding onto something in case of inertial dampener lag. After the brief flash, the entire delegation looked shocked - and excited. They huddled around each other. Their leader offered a proposal on the spot. They asked for a spacedock within a light year of the current Swarm location, three of their most powerful lightspeed accelerators, accurate coordinates to the Swarm Queen, wormhole access back to Earth to bring other resources, and as much tungsten as we could spare. Odd, but none seemed out of the ordinary - even youth on the World-City were trusted with lightspeed runabouts. We accepted. Three days later, they contacted us to announce they were ready, and just waiting for the leadership council. I was shocked when we arrived - all they'd done is cut the mass of tungsten in two and sit a lightspeed accelerator to each one. Their leader pressed a button. The tungsten mass shot off into space in the blink of an eye. And then..... fire. The part of space the Swarm were traveling through lit up white-hot, as though a supernova had occurred at lightspeed. The humans cheered. We cheered. The chair of the council told the Human leader they were proud to offer Humanity probationary access to the World-City, and if they stayed in good standing, after a few centuries, a seat on the junior council. It was a rote speech they'd given to dozens of new species over their tenure. The Human leader paused, as though he were deep in thought, and then bared the sharp spines around his nutrient intake orifice. \"I've got a counter-offer. Humans are given three seats on the senior council, including the Chairmanship.\" \"That's outrageous!\" \"Ask me why we asked for three lightspeed accelerators.\" He looked confused. \"Why did you ask for three lightspeed accelerators?\" \"Simple,\" he said, pacing across the room, until he was standing in front of the second mass of Tungsten. \"One for the Swarm queen. One to take home, study, reverse-engineer. And one to aim at the World-City in case you didn't like our counteroffer.\" The jokes were right. Humans were worse than the Swarm.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 49, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Everyday in school was the same, crisp monotone. Wake up, arrive, work, break, work, dinner, work, depart, homework, chill out, sleep. I was neither happy nor sad, especially. Some days were better than others but they all seemed similar. Then a new girl came into the class. Instantly I became curious about her, she was different to the others, there was a magnetism. The months went by and I couldn't stop looking at her, I tried not to look but I kept wanting to. My eyes would scan the room and she would attract them to look at her, I couldn't help it, she was the first person I thought was beautiful in the whole world. Nobody could compare. Time moved on, I got braver and told her how she felt. She ran. I was happy I had said something but it ended there, nothing new to report. Nothing changed. I became shy again, tried to focus on my work but I couldn't I was already distracted. My thoughts turned to her and then, before I knew it, time was up. I asked her to a movie before it was too late. I remember arriving and keeping an eye out for her but, she didn't show. I remember getting into the car with my father, I swore I may have seen her in the road looking for me but it may have been my imagination playing tricks. - Years went by, tried to put her out of my mind but it was no use. I got into relationships, they didn't last because I was still transfixed on this one person. It took nearly 7 years after school to get into a serious relationship but even then, the memory still corrupted everything. It was as if my once monotone world had returned but I had experienced technicolour and now, it wasn't enough to just be shades of grey. I found her again, by chance and we met. I was still living with my parents and she was a single mother by now. She confessed to me that she had regrets, wanted things to go differently for her but, time had moved on. We walked her dog, went to the cinema and then shared a kiss in the car. The kiss, which I had wanted for so long, was, sort of mediocre and in its mediocrity I found serenity. It was this moment that I recall something changed. This person, I had wanted for so long, was just a regular person. She didn't see me much after that, there were still elements within my mind that wanted her too much to let it go but I had already realized by this point that I was too invested in her to make it work and as I predicted, I sabotaged myself and made a fool of myself and then I began to reflect on everything I had learned over the years, of coping and hoping. I realized that people do deserve a chance and in doing so I ended up giving another person a shot, somebody who liked me in a similar way to the way I liked her. It lasted 2 years but ended brutally because it burned her that I was with her, because I was giving her a shot. Smaller relationships happened, and more reflection occurred, I found myself losing any feelings towards the person I had in the first place and learning more about how things are supposed to work. The more I realized the person I thought I loved was merely a facade in my own head, the more the world came into focus and the quicker the colour returned, I worked on myself and bettered myself, until one day I saw a person who made me stop and stare, in a similar way to before. Instead of getting crazy notions or giving somebody a shot, I just asked to meet and got to know her. We're still together to this day. I think, sometimes, it is best to get to know a person first, before judging them, you never know what will happen, but what ever you do, don't waste a decade.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 50, "lang": "en"}

No one believes your bullshit stories anymore.\" It was Treavor, a small boy, who weighed about 100 pounds on a good day. \"Maybe we would believe it if we were 13 still, but were 18 now, and we are about to graduate. You seriously need to grow up.\" James shot back, almost instantly, \"Lets see your scars then Treavor, where are yours?\" Treavor paused \"I.... I have to go\" and immediately ran out of the classroom and to the bathroom. Locking himself in the last stall, he sat down on the toilet and pulled his feet onto it so no one could see them. He immediately heard the door swing open and smash the wall, and the wind from it sent a chill up his spine. \"Lets give you your first scar, Treavor. Everyone else has them, and your perfect skin deserves one too.\" Treavor trembled as he could hear James kicking open stall after stall, and he was closing in on his. He reached into his pocket, and found a nothing but his keys. Quickly, Treavor put the keys between his knuckles as some sort of weapon, but realized that it was only going to hurt him more than anything. \"I'll show you a scar\" Treavor said to himself. James kicked open the last stall, he saw Treavor laying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, with long gashes crossing one of his wrists. \"Are you happy now, James?\" Stammered Treavor, as he faded away into the darkness.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 51, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "A soft breeze tenderly provoked the Mage's auburn hair as her gentle eyes surveyed the magnificent glacier known as'Duratus.' The air surrounding the glacier was frigid, and the Mage's rosy cheeks were beginning to chap from the bitter wind. The Mage glanced skyward to check the alignment of stars in the Fathom; the Seven Stars fell abroad to the Starking's Crown, which indicated the coming of dawn in a matter of moments. The Mage furrowed her brow and clenched her right fist around a strangely-shaped mechanical device. A sudden burst of light swept over the glacier as the sun emerged from its domain behind the Henric Mountains. The Mage ducked behind a slab of ice and observed a frozen clearing at the heart of Duratus. A singular sunbeam pierced through a distant wall of ice and illuminated an ancient symbol carved into the floor of the clearing. Lines of magic dust sprouted from the symbol lining as the floor of ice began to shift, revealing a grand stairwell of frozen water leading deep into the glacier. The Mage quickly glanced to her side and viewed her reflection in a glimmering wall of ice. The Mage managed a smirk as she activated the mechanism in her hand. A mystical, distorted aura enveloped her entire body, and her skin fell prey to a powerful tingling sensation. The Mage's wry smile grew as she witnessed her reflection disappearing from the nearby panel of ice. \"It worked,\" the Mage uttered beneath her chilled breath, \"Emma's Invision Mechanism worked.\" After the Mage thoroughly inspected herself and determined that the Invision Mechanism had successfully rendered her body completely invisible, she slipped out from her cover of ice and slinked toward the great staircase at the center of the clearing. As she approached her destination, a man cloaked azure robes emerged from the icy staircase and glided to the edge of the clearing. He lifted his arms in praise to the warming sun, and his skin began to smolder with unbridled power. As the Mage watched the man absorb the power of the sun, she felt twinges of fury and of pain; that wretched bastard wielded powers that did not belong to him. A whimper emerged from the Mage's lips as tears collected around her eyelids; her rended spirit had learned of despair and sorrow, and the cloaked man stood at the epicenter of her turmoil. \"God of the Fathom, hear my plea. Let my frozen tears pave a road of undying pain for this miserable man before me. Let this glacier turn crimson from the blood of his heart, and allow my sister to suffer no more.\" (at work and leaving to drive home, to be continued)", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 54, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "Sandra stood with hands on her hips and took in the sight of her newly-stocked kitchen. All those clumsy years of her mother hurriedly shoving her out of the kitchen and then rushing back in to deal with the smoke. Being held back a year in high school for repeatedly failing home economics. Managing, in her darkest moment, to fail at boiling water. But all that was over now. She'd fully equipped her kitchen with everything she'd need to make a proper meal - gleaming new knife sets, pots, pans, measuring cups, measuring spoons, cheese grater, turkey baster, electronic food timer, meat thermometer, cutting boards, roasting rack, fat separator, and one of those little bells they had in restaurants for the cook to ring and yell \"Order up!\" In retrospect, Sandra thought, she might have gone a little bit overboard with the shopping. But! Nothing was going to stop her from making her first Thanksgiving dinner. Sure, she'd been putting it off all day, choosing instead to spend time writing down lists of what she was thankful for, or experimenting with candlelight to see what would provide the best atmosphere for the meal, or pouring herself a glass or two of wine. But it was fine. Everything was going fine. She'd even lit a stick of incense to relax herself. She gave the bell a little ding for good luck, and got to work. She picked up the special herb knife she'd bought to cut up some sage, and immediately nicked the tip of her finger. \"Oh hell!\" she immediately cried out. It stung like mad, burning like a little blue flame. She shook her bleeding finger, turning to the open stove - she probably shouldn't have started it burning already - then to the open window, then to the flowerpot on it, then finally to the kitchen sink and stuck her bleeding finger under the water. All sorts of nasty words were running through her head. She stumbled back to the dining room and plopped down on a chair. This wasn't going how she had planned at all! Petulantly, she flipped through her cookbook and began to reread: In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas, Luciferi Excelsi. In the Name of Satan, Ruler of the Earth, True God, Almighty and Ineffable, Who hast created man to reflect in Thine own image and likeness, I invite the Forces of Darkness to bestow their infernal power upon me. Open the Gates of Hell to come forth to greet me as your Sister and friend. Deliver me O Mighty Satan from all past error and delusion, fill me with truth, wisdom and understanding, keep me strong in my faith and service, that I may abide always in Thee with Praise, Honor and Glory be given Thee forever and ever. \"Wait a minute,\" Sandra said, standing up, \"this isn't my cookbook at all!\" She threw her head back and sighed and polished off the glass of wine she had poured for herself. \"Well,\" she said, picking up the Thanksgiving list she had made earlier, \"maybe I'm not a cook, but at least - Oh hell!\" The paper caught flame, having come too close to a lit candle, and she flung it desperately into a silver serving bowl to burn itself out. Sandra sniffed in the familiar smell of ashes and burning dreams, looked at the still uncooked, unprepared turkey taunting her on the countertop. She dropped her forehead against the table and closed her eyes and tried to relax. The sound of the door opening made her abruptly lift her head. \"Hi, honey,\" her husband Alistair said, walking in through the door. He bent down to kiss her and paused at the sight of the lit candles and the ashes in the serving bowl and their Satanic Bible still spread open on the table. He smirked at her. \"You doing a little Satanic ritual to help with your cooking?\" \"No Sandra started to say, then ran backward over the day's events. She'd rung the bell, invoked the powers of Hell and the elements while turning counterclockwise with her athame, she'd read the invocation, drank from the chalice, focused her prayers in the fire, and meditated. \"Well what do you know,\" she said brightly. \"I guess I did!\" Alistair looked over into the kitchen. \"Sandra,\" he groaned, \"are you really counting on Satan to make you a better cook? Because seriously, I \"No, no, you're right,\" Sandra said. \"You know what this ritual has made me realize? I don't need to be a good cook. This compulsive need that I have to be a good housemaker, to provide for other people - that's just weakness masquerading as a desire for competence! I've opened the Gates of Hell, I don't need to be dependent on anyone else's energies! Fuck cooking! I'm done with it!\" \"Well don't that beat all,\" Alistair beamed. \"Hail Satan!\" \"Hail Satan!\" she said, and rang the bell.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 56, "lang": "en"}

Bitsy took a deep breathe, inhaling the scent of musty clothes, stale shoe leather, and caught a whiff of the faint odor that had been lingering for an entire week...... It was the smell of a worm. A dead, decomposing worm that the monster had placed inside her bedroom as she slept..... right next to her pillow, tucked underneath a blanket..... surely..... she KNEW IT WAS THERE....... She opened the door, sighed in relief when nothing was there. She knew to shield her eyes, but unwary of tricks, she let her hands fall from her face, confident she would not meet the gaze of a terror. As she peered into the gloom, a sleeve brushed her shoulder and she jumped, but quickly brushed it off, desperately trying to be brave, to hide her terror from Mother, tucked away in her corner, honorably discarded, judging. And then suddenly, a miniature beast sprang from her hiding place underneath the bed, much smaller than Bitsy had seen in her nightmares. So much smaller, Bitsy thought with a shudder...... It threw itself into view, silhouetted against the block of pale light streaming in through the hole in it's wall...... Hateful light, gleaming off the eyes of the monster before her, locked on her own...... Unable to look away, Bitsy's skin began to pinch, ruffle, a hideous sort of mold growing along her arms..... her stomach...... The monster stared her down, arms above it's head, wiggling it's fingers theatrically in a display of true and utter insanity...... She felt her entire body begin to firm, toe to top expanding under it's gaze..... each orifice of her body sealing, much to her utter terror...... Nose flattening against her cheeks, stitches winding through her lips, forcing a terrifying, uniform smile...... She could not believe this was happening to her, already..... The last to go were her eyes...... Breathe trapped in her lungs, never to be released, she could not even pant in horror as her sight blurred..... everything took on a hideous shine as she felt the balls case over, to remain permanently open, sightless, frozen......

{"text": "\"Hmm. What about that one?\" The young man pointed at a humble looking thing hiding behind the more elaborate displays on the back wall of the arms trader. The trader in question, a man who is no stranger to a roast boar or three, looks at first with disinterest - but then lights up with a smile of reassurance. \"Oh..... Oh! You have a keen eye for detail sir! That blade is one of the finest in my collection. It may appear to be a simple thing, a product of unskilled hands, but it is not. It's edge is sharp and it strikes true!\" The trader's belly shook in time with his rosy red cheeks, and as planned the naive young man bought into the story and gladly presented a purse full of coin. He emptied the entire thing onto the table and muscle memory alone had the trader grab the gold and put it back in his much larger purse. At last, the silver tongued peddler thought to himself, I have finally managed to get rid of that useless old thing. Others may feel concern for this new adventurer, and may not have taken advantage of this lack of experience in weapons - but those people are fools! Only the coin counts. The transaction complete, the young man walked out of the shop. That was supposed to be that, but the chipped old blade surprised both. The moment the sunlight hit it, the sword began to glow. Before their very eyes the sword re-made itself. The chips disappeared, the stress lines in the metal melted away. Even the leather strap at the hilt regained it's colour, as if it were freshly replaced. Once the pommel reformed in what looked like the finest silver, encrusted with beautiful rubies no less, the tradesman began to feel sick. The young man looked at his new blade with interest, but curiously was not as mystified as the trader - his mouth still wide open. He looked back at the bashful liar and simply nodded to him. \"You are correct good sir, it is the finest blade in your collection. Quite the bargain I must say, I shall be sure to let all who require arms know that you are fair.\" The words alone gave half the story, but the look in the young man's eyes showed a different picture than before. These eyes are experienced, and not swayed by trader talk. The trader was left to curse himself, while desperately grabbing all of his collection and laying them out in the dying hours of sunlight.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 60, "lang": "en"}

Libra was at least six feet tall, sported a more-salt-than-pepper haircut, and he had slim, muscular build, despite what the ill-fitting suit looked like. Even from across the room, I could see his nicked ear, proof that he was a hero once. But according to his files, he hadn't been one for a long time. His last confirmed save was before I was even born. I don't know why the Hero's Guild even lets him retain membership, let alone take on sidekicks. I flip through the stack of papers from his file, searching for, I don't know, something. I don't even care if he notices me. We're supposed to meet in two hours, when I'll be officially on duty with him, but I've been watching him all day, hoping that the files were somehow wrong. His strength, speed, durability, all of his stats, average. Mediocre. No rescues in 22 years, no villains or anti-heroes taken down, nothing. When I saw his power was listed as \" Special typing ,\" I had some hope. That was, until he got mugged this morning. Gave the guy his wallet and everything! If I didn't want to be in the Hall so bad, I would have dropped this training program and become a vigilante. Those guys are pretty popular right now. \" You've got ta be kidding, this is stupid. \" I mumbled, my thoughts spilling into words. \" Ulthor, is it? May I take this seat? \" Even with my acute senses, I didn't even realize that Libra stood by my table. Probably because he was so unremarkable that I just completely tuned him out. \" Sure, it's all yours. \" I tried putting all the papers away before he could see, but even someone like him had time to figure out that they were all of his files from the Guild. \" I was just getting ready for tonight. I guess you know I'm assigned to you. \" Libra had this knowing smile on his face that was already pissing me off. He'd caught me red-handed, studying him, disappointed I was stuck with him, and yet he was wearing a stupid grin. \" Well, Ulthor, let's not lie to each other. Let's be frank. You would prefer that, wouldn't you? \" He leaned forward onto the table, hands clasped together in front of him, still smiling just enough to annoy me. \" You've been looking into me, and I've been looking into you. You're quite talented. I won't deny that. \" Of course I am. I'm the best hero the Academy has seen in years. \" You're no doubt the strongest hero the Academy has seen in a decade. \" I hate this guy. He is so slow. I'm so used to thinking quickly and being two steps ahead that I don't even remember how to move at Libra's speed. Which is, I guess, normal person speed. Human speed. \" You performed excellently in all scenarios given to you at the Academy, which is no surprise since you were five years old for your first save! Color me impressed. \" Color me regretful. Libra finally stopped smiling, settling on a quizzical look. \" I can see on your face that you dislike me. You feel like you've made a mistake choosing me for your mentor after learning about me. Is this true? \" \" I don't know if I'd call it a mistake, I just... \" Thank heavens I can think as quickly as I do, or else this would have been an awkward pause. Oops, too late, it got awkward. \" I just don't know how you're going to teach me to be a hero, is all. \" And there it was, his smile was back. \" Is your goal to make it into the Hall, Ulthor? Is that why you want to be a hero? \" A waitress came by and dropped off some steaming coffee for Libra, who thanked her quickly, and they exchanged smiles. I'd have to get used to this. \" Well, I want to save people. I want to make the world a better place. \" My mentor raised an eyebrow, blowing into the cup. Right, be frank. \" And yes, I want to get into the Hall. \" Libra sipped the coffee and got out his checkbook. \" You chose me because I have the most heroes immortalized. Peggy, Royce, Lee, Sue..... \" \" ...Ellipse, Dangeroyce, Ever-Steel, Faye. And Veir, Dan the Incredible, Hercules... \" I cut in, naming them by their Hero names, plus a few more I remembered. \" Yeah, the instructors at the Academy told me to come to you for my sidekick phase. Why? \" He signed the check for the coffee and waved bye to the staff in back, who all smiled and waved back. \" I have a different perspective than most other heroes, I think. So I propose this. Come with me for the rest of the day, see what I have to offer, and you can decide if you want me to train you. Tonight, if you feel you have nothing to learn from me, I'll write your recommendation for Hero status.

{"text": "It was called \" The Ark Project .\" At least, that was the name that the news and social media had come up with, once they'd stuck their collective noses into the affairs of the World Government. The World Government - an evolution of the now defunct U.N. - wasn't really the world government, of course. Everyone knew that. While there were some countries that weren't around anymore - and almost all of them because they'd been either absorbed by larger countries, or had merged to become newer countries - there were still more than a dozen's dozen still around, and they were all still independent, sovereign nations. What the World Government was, was something akin to the world equivalent of what had once been the Congress in the United States, before its citizens, finally fed up with the political corruption that had run so rampant that it was openly talked about, even in the news media, had all but revolted, refusing to support their congressional appointees, and calling for its abolishment. Not that the media had cared at all about that tidbit of history. They were much more interested in the particulars of the Ark Project, and in trying to figure out just why it was that the World Government had been so secretive about it. To the media, secrets were meant to be exposed, especially if they were government secrets, and since they were World Government secrets, the media believed that there shouldn't be any secrets they weren't privy to. It didn't take too long before the major outlines of the Ark Project were brought to light; it wasn't a huge secret that prison over-crowding was becoming a problem the world ' round, that many of the prisons - even the low security ones - were seriously overcrowded, in some cases so much so that the prisoners slept in shifts, so that it could be said that each prisoner had a bed to sleep in. The Ark Project, the media managed to uncover, was an idea conceived during a number of meetings of the World Government, in order to discuss, and then come up with a solution, to the world's prison overcrowding situation. The solution, the outline identified, was two-fold: the first was to find a way to make productive assets of the prisoners, rather than keep them contained in prisons in almost inhumane conditions, and the second was to use the volunteer prisoners in a colonization project. There had been a few manned trips to Mars already, and there were still few moons orbiting Saturn and Jupiter that were candidates for remote stations to be put together, and so it was decided that the volunteer prisoners would be the ' test subjects'to build those stations. The news was met with a considerable amount of positive fanfare. Once the news of the Ark Project was leaked, the project - now unfettered - seemed to proceed at an almost frenetic pace, and inside of a year the last of the first wave of volunteer prisoners - totaling nearly a hundred thousand from just about every corner of the world - had been put into cryogenic sleep and shuttled up into high earth orbit to wait for the space engines, as they were known, to fire up and take the cargo pods on their way to their destinations. Briefly, it was wondered, ' why so many prisoner volunteers? ', but the matter had been explained away that the building of the remote space stations would take a considerable amount of time and there was no way to replace someone who was accidentally injured or killed. The truth of the matter - that the prisoners weren't really going to Jupiter- or Saturn- to build remote space stations - and that they were actually simply being fired off into the sun - wouldn't be discovered for nearly another century...", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 62, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Magic is pretty prevalent where I'm from. There are a couple of different types, and I'm not really read up on how they all work, but I'll try to explain them. Most prominent is blue magic. Blue mages are typically either elementalists or conjurers, and my sister Eleanor is the latter. She took fencing classes in college, so she uses her magic to compress the mana in the air into the solid form of a rapier. Her daughter Marie practices both fencing and kendo, but she can't use magic. Personally, I think it's because she's a latent Silver mage, like her father was. See, Silver mages generate power within their bodies, unlike other kinds who have to pull it from the environment. It manifests as a silver flame, and what it does varies immensely from one person to the next. But someone can't learn Silver magic, they have to be born as a Silver mage. And in the same way, Silver mages are incapable of performing any other kind of magic. It's become something of a rarity these days, because about 17 years ago, a cataclysmic event wiped out almost all of the silver mages, and the ones who survived went into hiding. This event was caused by a man named Louis Tucker, founder and CEO of a corporation dedicated to protecting people from rogue Silver mages. Tucker, along with a coworker by the name of Nicholas Calhoun, were both White mages posing as Silvers. To be honest, I didn't even know White magic existed before Tucker and I had a..... disagreement. Long story short, Nick ended up losing his life attempting to stop Tucker, and ultimately failed. I did recently meet his son, Roy, however. He's being looked after by Monica Dunbar, Eleanor's physical therapist, and her husband Richard. Roy practices both Blue and Red magic, using the Blue magic for pyromancy (he's a teenager, what can you do) and the Red to enchant the blades that he and his adoptive brother Eric make in their garage. They're pretty close with my niece, Marie (I think she and Eric are dating) and another young boy Eleanor's been looking after named Zeke. Zeke never seems to talk, except to Roy. Still, he's a good kid and a Black mage, meaning he's adept at creating illusions and that sort of thing. It helps him when he wants to be alone, not that I can blame him. That kid looks like he's been through a lot, and it's a good thing he has such good friends. It's a tough world out there. But they're tough kids. They can handle anything life throws at them. .....

Where's the sword? \" Darius can only stare at him, focused on the dark scruff across his cheeks. \" For fuck's sake! \" The man picks Darius up with some effort, throwing him across the saddle of a horse before hopping on. \" You better hope that Isadora doesn't get hurt for you, because I'm going to do worse than Vervain would to you if that's the case! \" The man smacks the reins, sending the horse flying across the grassy, moonlit field. With each stride of the horse, Darius feels more pain run through him. He's more like dead weight for the horseman compared to someone actually trying to stay on. He closes his eyes, gritting his teeth against the tears that threaten to come. It wasn't supposed to be like this.

{"text": "Ted Slagnerton sat and stared at the wall. The diplomas and degrees looked rather nice. As the secretary walked into the office, he stood up and smiled at her. \"Hi there\" he said holding out his hand. She brushed past him without meeting his eyes. \"Sorry. No hands, it's a safety thing..... germs. Not any distrust of you. Germ thing is all.\" She was kind of mousy with thick glasses and her hair done up in a bun. The blue pant suit with orange stripes was a bit off putting and looked like it was badly tailored. All in all, she was a great combo of everything that usually turned him off, but for some reason he was instantly attracted to her. \"Fair'nough. Is your boss here yet?\" She shook her head. \"No. He's running late, traffic jam. Asked me to brief you on some stuff while you're waiting.\" She pulled out a manilla folder. \"So, for starters, you know why you're here right?\" He sat back down. \"Only vaguely. I was told by my house mates that your boss had contacted us about trying to foster peace and prosperity, but there weren't any details.\" \"Well, I'll get to the details in a moment, but first..... are you guys at all interested in making peace?\" \"Yeah totally. This thing with the Boners has been bad for everybody.\" She frowned at him. Then her eyes lit up. \"Boners is a euphemistic nickname for your rival society. Cute. Compare them to penises, because you probably think in crude terms a lot. They surly have a similar term for your society.\" Ted nodded. \"Yeah, they call us the numbskulls.\" She smiled for a brief second. \"So, this'thing' as you put it has resulted in 84 injuries and 17 deaths. Any ideas for a better name than'thing'?\" He got uncomfortable and shifted in his seat. \"Look, we know. Alright, we get it. Things have gotten out of hand, and what started as a series of pranks has escalated and we want to unescalate it. I'm still not clear on why your boss cares at all though.\" She grinned for a split second and then shook her head. \"Prescott is often unclear in his reasons. Right now, the only thing I know, is that he wants to put a stop to the violence because it's bad for business when it's here at home instead of over seas. I'm sure he can see a way to profit from it long term though.\" She came around the desk and took a seat next to him. \"Tell me..... I'm sorry, I forgot to do the name exchanging thing. I'm Clarissa. You're Ted right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"So tell me Ted, how much do you know about chronomancy?\" He smiled and took the folder she was holding out to him. \"This may surprise you, but I studied it as a minor in college. I know that most of the field is theoretical due to the high energy needed for even basic manipulations and the heavy regulations around it.\" She smiled back. \"I think you'll find that Prescott is able to get around regulations, and he has the resources to get energy for a lot of high end endeavors. Take a look over the plan.\" After a half hour of reading through documents Ted set the folder down. \"This is a solid plan. Has your boss talked tot he Boners yet?\" She nodded. \"He's on his way back from meeting with one of their representatives at his office in New York. If traffic hadn't...\" just then her pager went off. \"Excuse me.\" She left the room and came back after five minutes with a look of irritation mixed with concern on her face. \"Prescott just got a call about one of his grandsons. He's been in an accident and is on the way to the ICU. He's going to have to reschedule.\" Ted stood up. \"Completely understand. Family is so important. I'm busy tomorrow through Friday, so if he's up for a meeting on Saturday that'd work, if not Monday's good.\" She jotted down some notes on a pad of paper that had floated over to her hands. As he headed towards the door, Ted asked \"Outta curiosity, what the name of the grandson?\" She paused \"Jebediah. Why?\" \"I was thinking of sending some flowers and a book or two to read. I know it's boring being laid up in medical care.\" She smiled at him. \"Ted..... would you like to have dinner with me tonight?\" Ted smiled back. \"Yeah, if now's a good time, I know a place not far from here.\" Three weeks later, the arrangements had been made. They'd use chronomancy to stop the problem before it started, by going back to the founding of each group and having them merged together. There'd also be a charter drawn up on putting magic on the DL so as to avoid things like this happening. As he sat across the table from Carl Brandistock he smiled. \"So, there's really only one thing left to sort out. What'll we call ourselves?\" Carl shrugged \"Might as well combo the names of both groups. The Society of Bones and Skulls has a nice ring to it.\" Ted shook his head \"I think The Skull and Bones Society sounds better.\" Carl smirked. \"Rock Paper Scissors?\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 65, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "Most people go through life with the ability to see. It doesn't matter if they need glasses, contacts or even corrective eye surgery they can see. Well I needed none of those as I was growing up. It was the day of my 13th birthday, I had finally become a teenager. I'd been waiting for this moment for as long as I could remeber. In my family once you turned 13 you received a special ability. My mom's was the ability to grow anything she wanted as quickly as she wanted so long as she had a seed. She made a killing in Colorado, buying one weed plant and getting it's seeds. She became rich instantly. My dad is a normal guy he doesn't have any powers but my older brother Kylar has a phenomenal power. He can time travel. Now I don't mean like a minute or so forward or backwards, no he can go years in either direction. He's become a super hero and helps out tons of people. He'll visit every once and a while and drop off some gadgets he's gotten from the future. But enough about my family it's time to get back to my story. So it was my 13th birthday and I was waiting for this special ability to kick in. I'd been waiting for a few hours when suddenly I felt it. I was receiving so much sensory detail that I immediately passed out. I'd gotten the ability to look through any kind of lens, be it human eyes, a camera or even glasses. I was elated because here I was a 13 year old kid with the ability to see anything I wanted wherever I wanted to see it so long as I knew where the lens was. Then one hour after receiving this extraordinary gift I would need to rely on it for the rest of my life. My brother had come to celebrate my birthday and he'd brought back a new gadget for me. It was a virtual reality device from 100 years in the future. I strapped on the device and began looking at things differently when all of a sudden I felt my head begin to hurt from sensory overload. It was such a sharp acute pain that I passed out falling forward and breaking the virtual reality device. The glass of the device shattered and punctured my eyes. No one was around as this happened so I lay there until I awoke. Immediately after waking up I realized I couldn't see. My eyes had been destroyed by the glass. They looked normal, the glass had come out and the eyes had no wounds but I couldn't see with them. That's when I began using my ability to its fullest. I was a bit disoriented with it at first but eventually I could pinpoint exactly where someone was and use their eyes as my own. I even began carrying around a camera just to see. I'd aim it at something and look through it. That's what lead me to get a career as a professional photographer. My work has appeared in many museums and books and I've grown quite rich. I've traveled the world and seen some amazing things through my camera lens. Today I decided to, really think a boat qnf take some pictures out in the ocean. I was using my camera as my eyes when suddenly my boat began rocking. The waves were growing stronger and stronger and we're sweeping over the boats railing. I lost my grip in my camera and it fell overboard and sank to the bottom of the ocean. I was stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way of seeing anything around me. It was at that moment that I knew I was screwed. I had very little food, water and no way to communicate with anyone. I couldn't see anything goes and how no way of operating the boat without seeing where I was driving it. It was at that point that I broke down and cried. I don't know how long I was out there until I got dehydrated and delusional imagining all kinds of things. I believe it was a week. Eventually my brother came out manning a boat and found me in the middle of the ocean. He'd time traveled to the future to see my boat eventually get beached but I'd died so he traveled back in time to as close as he could to the approximate location of where he'd figured out I'd be. I was returned home safely and now my family knows of my blindness. I don't know why I kept it a secret for so long bit now I have a small pair of glasses on a necklace around my neck with me wherever I go just in case I lose my camera again.

The crooks, murderers, rapists, they get what's coming to them in the end, world's still spinning isn't it? So the immortals, in large stick to their bed times. They can't see you too well, failing eyesight is the first sign of a hungry octogenarian, and only the outcasts starve. When dawn approached we finally reached Downtown, trying to find some last sanctuary. Can't get out of the city, once oldies realised mortality was in the grasp after murder, a lot of them went around to live ye older life on the farms bordering the town. They also became the guards for anyone trying to escape. Not many of us are left.

Some of these guys still run marathons, so we have to keep moving. After we got discovered we went through into the old \"Emo park,\" now called \"Sunrise Orchards,\" and actually saw a Lynching! Rows of punks, hippies, gays all lined up next to a noose. Had a man up on stage next to the noose turning a wheel with a bunch of balls with numbers on them. Pedro heard him shout \"48!\" One of them shouted \"BINGO!\" went up, strung up one from the line, pulled it. And. That sound still pinches at my neck. Pedro was about to get sick so we had to bolt out of there before they saw the grass. We've found shelter in an Apple store, they detest these places still. We've rigged the place with tripwire to play \"Limp Bizkit,\" just in case we need to rush an escape. We saw some graffiti before the entrance, just high enough for them to not clean it.

{"text": "\"The signal was faint but the message was clear. The ISS had been crippled. It's still in orbit but not for long. And the Captain is going down with his ship,\" I recounted, shaking. \"The Captain? We're talking about Kelly right?\" my supervisor replied incredulously. I nodded, and we both knew what the next question was. Who the hell was waiting in medical? \"Keep a lid on this for the moment,\" the supervisor said, fumbling through stacks of materials, \"alright come with me.\" We rode in silence over to the medical facility, designed for comfortable quarantine and decontamination of astronauts returning from their missions. The stillness in the air set my hairs on end. The main corridor was deserted, and despite it being late there should've been someone here, even a random maintenance person. Our footsteps fell heavily in the hall, echoing back in short intervals. \"I don't like this,\" I thought aloud. \"This isn't the movies, son,\" the older man replied quickly without breaking stride, \"your shadow won't bite.\" We reached Q1, and Kelly was laying comfortably in bed, seemingly asleep. We both let out a low sigh of relief, I wanted to laugh but stifled it the best I could. \"So the question is, who is still up there, since Kelly is down here,\" he brainstormed, \"he reported equipment malfunction, could comms have been delayed?\" \"I..... don't know,\" I said.

{"text": "\"I can't believe it's already been ninety years, \" I say to know one in particular, not that anyone ever came to this park anymore. Or if they did, they didn't venture over the hill to find the solitary bench nestled underneath the willow tree, I guess a hundred lives makes a man pensive. I look beside me and see the small Rune Blade laying momentarily forgotten next to the small bouquet. The strange metal almost appeared to glow as it reflected the fiery light of the sunset. The sunsets always were beautiful this time of year and this park always reminded me of Lucy. She loved this bench and the willow. Even when the cancer made her too weak to walk, she would ask me to push the wheelchair over the hill so she could enjoy the last light of the late-summer days. She knew my secret, one of the few who did, and loved me anyway. You can't buy love like that, not in ten lives, not in a thousand. Sure, Lucy had passed on back in the 1820s, eight lifetimes ago; sure their had been other women, Dianne, Roxy, Susanna, Mae Lee; but none of them were her, and none of them could fill the hole she left. Nothing did. I look back over at the Rune Blade. Restoring youth didn't particularly hurt, it didn't really feel like anything; in fact, it was downright mundane. A simple slit of the throat, a moment of dizziness, and suddenly the years vanished and you were left as good as.... well as good as new. But it didn't work for anyone else. It couldn't save Lucy. I look at the small grave underneath the willow and shudder as a lone tear rolls down my cheek. Maybe it's time I finally did say goodbye. Time to move on and see what lies beyond. I slowly get to my feet and pick up the bouquet of wildflowers. I walk over to the base of the willow and set the carefully arrange stems softly by the headstone.

{"text": "Day 1 - North America's Patient Zero I woke up with an extremely painful, throbbing sensation in my neck. Initially, I thought it might have been delayed onset muscle soreness from my workout yesterday, but I had never experienced anything to that magnitude before. I examined the area in my mirror and noticed two tiny bite marks - my skin did not look swollen, bruised, or blemished otherwise. Since it is the summer, I usually leave my window wide open. Perhaps an insect - a mosquito or spider - got through the screen. Day 3 The pain hasn't subsided, so I went to my family doctor and had some blood samples taken. She was surprised to see me - I was known to have a superior immune system and ultra-rapid metabolism. I rarely got sick, and on the chance moments when I did, I was usually better before the day finished. Even my recovery from exercising was astounding. Day 5 I'm starting to think it was some kind of spider bite. I've started to lose my appetite. I can still eat, but I just don't feel an urge to anymore. My exercises and workouts don't seem to be affected; in fact, I feel stronger. The pain in my neck has decreased substantially. Day 6 I think I'm having an allergic reaction. I woke up super itchy for some reason. Throughout the day, my entire body would not stop itching. Nothing I tried seemed to work. Day 8 My skin is on fire. I woke up and leaped off of my bed. My roommate ran into my room because I had screamed like someone out of a horror movie - Cassandra thought someone had broken into my room. I spent the day sitting on our couch watching Netflix. Fortunately, my skin stopped being irritated once I left my room. Day 9 I don't know what's happening. I can...smell things. I can smell what Cass had for breakfast. I can smell the flowers hanging from Samantha's window. Samantha is one of our apartment neighbors, we all live on the fifth floor. Her room is on the opposite end of the building. I can smell every ingredient every tenant on our floor is using to cook. I can smell Cassandra. She's...intoxicating. It's not perfume, or lotion, or any cosmetic. It's her actual scent. Her raw, sensual aroma. I know she got her period early. We are usually synchronized, but she got hers a day early. I could smell it. Day 10 I haven't eaten all day. My stomach hasn't rumbled either. The smells of the world can be overwhelming. I learned quickly that if I clear my mind and focus on myself, I can block out the scents. I can also hone in on things - I've been practicing all day. I tried to walk to the gym, but it felt like I was thrown in a vat of acid the moment I stepped outside. I tried again at night, and that worked out perfectly. I think I have a skin condition - perhaps some kind of allergic reaction from whatever bit me? My strength has improved. Immensely. The weights I used to warm up with used to be my one-rep max. I stayed at the gym for nearly three hours and didn't even break a sweat. Day 11 Something has happened to my vision. I can see better in the dark. Better. I can see farther and pick up more detail the darker the conditions. I even tried a pitch black setting - I turned off all the lights in the apartment after Cass fell asleep - and was able to navigate through the flat even more efficiently than during the day. I haven't had anything to eat or drink yet. Day 12 It's the sunlight. I'm fairly certain I've developed an allergy to sunlight. I looked for a thin stretch of light in my room and passed my finger through it. The pain was even more excruciating than the one I experienced in my neck nearly two weeks ago. I nearly screamed when I saw my skin sizzling. Day 13 My doctor called. She said the results of my blood work revealed no abnormalities. Since the pain in my neck was gone, we both agreed that there would be no need for further testing. I didn't mention my allergy. I don't know why. Day 14 I can't stop thinking about Cass. I can't stop thinking about how good she smells. Her scent. Her hair. Her lips. I can smell every and any part of her. I don't feel hungry or thirsty...but..... ...I feel something else. Day 15 With all the weird changes happening to my body I just realized something critical. I haven't gotten my period yet. Day 17 I can't be pregnant - I haven't had sex in a long time. Maybe the stress of everything happening to me has shifted my period over by a few days. Maybe. Day 18 There is something very wrong with me. I don't know what came over me. When Cass left for work, I tore open one of our gourmet steak packages. I threw the absorbent pad into my mouth and sucked all of the juices out. I've never tasted anything so amazing, so perfect. I think I need help. Day 19 I got a new contract today. Fortunately, my job as a programmer - usually website design - allows me to work from home. Cass left to go visit her parents for the weekend. I think my circadian rhythms have finally shifted to match my new sleeping pattern - I sleep through most of the day and stay up all night. Day 21 - The Hunger I need to get out of here. I thought the feeling would go away in a few days, but it hasn't. I can't stop thinking about it. Every fibre of my being is urging me into one direction. I need to taste Cassandra.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 74, "lang": "en"}

Twelve miles away, smoke rose from the wrecked town of Bergenne. Sergeant Vaughn sighed into his hands. One of the techs paused for a moment, before turning back to his work. Dr. Muller sipped at his coffee, looking at Vaughn with a tired expression. \"I just can't believe it, doc. I lost three men fighting that thing.\" \"I am sorry to hear that.

In front of them, a black ooze gurgled in the large smoking crater. \"Fire in the hole!\" One of them men shouted as he lobbed a grenade into the pit. A few seconds later the explosion launched hundreds of small black shards into the air. The men hunkered down, as the area around them was pattered by these small projectiles. In the back of the diner, an injured soldier lay sat propped against the wall. He winced, as the medic removed the dressing. \"Easy there, Jo.

Kreig has two AT rockets left. If it decides to pop out of the hole again, we should be fine.\" Day sighed. \"Negative, soldier, last time we shot at the thing, our bullets jut bounced off. We're not going to fair much better.\" Stevens radio crackled to life again. \"Attention, Echo squad. New information has come up from the Europeans.

{"text": "\"Marc,\" I said as we all huddled behind the fake wall of the cave. \"It seems that we forgot the tapioca for desert.\" \"I think we have bigger concerns than that Bianca. Did you forget that we're smuggling sponges?\" That's what the United States government was calling them. It had only been 20 years earlier, that the vote was passed with a 3 majority voting yes. Everybody over the age of 65 was deemed a sponge, and was to be executed with haste to conserve resources there were plenty of. The following months had been horrific. All sponges were put in buses with SWAT members, and brought to gas chambers across the nation. Several were put up in every state. Still, many had managed to stay hidden, and many had the need to disappear. Most that we transported were in their late 50's and early 60's, so that they could get out before the government started monitoring them. The oldest we had ever seen was an 88 year old man. \"I guess, but you know how irritable they can get sometimes. I just don't want any of them starting an argument, because you KNOW that we can never win those.\" I whispered in his ear and ended with a chuckle. The Underground railroad was more populated now than it was when it was actually the Underground Railroad. However, there were many caves and vacant houses along the path that worked great, and we took full advantage of it. Most civilians didn't care about what we were doing. We were just concerned about the Sponge Police. I know the name sounds silly, but they were no joke. The SP was a division at many police stations. They mainly just wandered around popular spots that sponges were know to hide in. They are also looking for people like us. We're like the coyotes that used to bring people into America. Now, we use the Railroad for it's original purpose: Freedom from America. \"Oh well. Listen up everybody, get out your sleeping bags, it's time to go to sleep for the night. Remember, we go out late tomorrow, at about 9 a.m. after the patrols have left the area. So if you wake up before then, be sure to be as quiet as possible. This stretch is never searched, but we can't take any chances.\" We knew the patrol's schedules along our route down to the minute. Marc turned off all of the lanterns and climbed into our king sized sleeping bag. The next morning at about 9:30, after everybody had eaten breakfast, I carefully removed the fake cave wall, and Marc and I slowly walked out, assault rifles drawn. \"OK everybody, we have today and two more days until we reach Quebec. You are all doing tremendously so far. Let's have another great day and get to the next hideout, a vacant house, which is about 25 miles away.\" A few decades before the Spongocaust, Quebec had finally managed to get their own independence. It was where all the coyotes like me and Marc brought our Sponges. A few months after America voted yes, so did Canada. Quebec and Mexico were the only two places in North America that sponges could live freely in. You went to whichever one was closer, and we worked in North-Eastern America. We had known each other all our lives, Marc and I. We lived next door to each other as kids. The day that the ASA (Anti-Sponge Act) was passed, local police came up to Marc's house and took away his 66 year old father. Marc didn't leave his house for days, and I was over at his house all day, crying with him. His mother was only 64 for a few more months though, and my parents were in their late 50's. We took the three of them and devised a plan. They were our first passengers. While the ASA was still just a popular plan, Quebec had signed an agreement with America, stating that they wouldn't try to stop America if they didn't try to force Quebec into sponge killing. So that was where we brought the three of them. We had then decided to make a business out of it. It wasn't often that we ran into danger, but today had been one of the days that we did. As we were walking through the woods, with the sound of leaves crunching under our feet, nothing had felt out of the ordinary. We had just picked up again after our lunch break, and it around 2 o'clock. All of our sponges had more energy now, and wouldn't need a break for around an hour. See, one of the biggest problems with the elderly was that they were always tired. It made sense, but it was still annoying as hell. Marc and I were in our late 30's, and were fit because we had to be for this job. One of the sponges, a 63 year old man named Collin asked if we could stop for a minute. His wife's asthma was acting up again, and she was rooting around her backpack for her inhaler. \"Of course.\" I said. \"But please try to hurry. We wouldn't want to get behind schedule and be still walking in the dark.\" Of course, that didn't matter, because she couldn't see very well, and fumbled around her knapsack for around 3 minutes before realizing that she was looking in the wrong pocket. As she was breathing in from her inhaler, a loud gunshot rang out. \"Everybody, get down!\" Marc screamed as he looked around for where it came from. By the time he had found the source however, I had already fired about five shots into the man's torso. He was dressed in hunting gear, with a hunting rifle, and was sitting in a tree stand. \"Nice shot babe.\" Marc said as he stood up. \"NOOOOO!\" We looked over in the direction of the scream, only to see the woman who had just stopped for her inhaler, holding her best friend, Melanie. Only, Melanie had been shot in the neck. The woman holding her, Maria, was covered in blood, and crying. \"OK, everybody, we have to get going. We don't know if this man called anybody before he fired on us. There's a well-hidden meadow just over a click in the direction we're going. We'll get the body, and we can bury here there.\" Marc took out one of his several survival blankets he carried with him and tied it around her neck, so that there wasn't a blood trail that could be followed. We were walking again in two and a half minutes. Btw, I'm really liking the idea of writing a novel about Bianca and Marc's first journey getting their parents to Quebec.

{"text": "The conference room began to fill up a little past 10am, the scheduled time for the HR meeting. Phillip found his seat and took out a pen and moleskin notebook. The more experienced administrators piled around the breakfast buffet, loading up on cheese danishes, donuts, fruit, and coffee. They knew once the show started they could not get back up. Phillip did not like to eat in the morning, and found that the food offered at these meetings always looked unappetizing in comparison to the stale procedure of the human resource department's presentations. Waiting for the employees to find their seats, Gregory pressed his collated paperwork to the front of his khakis. He did not like public speaking, but the rest of his department assured him that he was the best speaker amongst them all and that his voice was very attractive. He agreed to take the position as the main representative of HR on the condition that someone would have to buy him lunch after each appointment. The office agreed, and rotated who would buy Greg lunch. Today was Matthew McCassland's turn. \" Did everybody help themselves to breakfast and coffee? \" Gregory asked. Benjamin held up a half-eaten apple turnover in his hand and received a light chuckle. Gregory smiled. \" Great. So, today we're meeting in light of a new policy regarding the Legal Homicide Act. So that we're all on the same page, does everybody understand what the Legal Homicide Act does? \" Everyone in attendance nodded. Reading off of his paperwork, Gregory continued, \" The Legal Homicide Act set the precedent that every citizen is allowed to kill one person legally in their lifetime. While the Legal Homicide Act is still being rectified in light of some unforeseen consequences of the new law, it is apparent now that the law is here to stay. Because of how the act changes the relationships between human beings on a fundamental level, the... \" Gregory found a typo in his written presentation. He shook his head and continued, \" the company has to also change to reflect the new law, so there will now be changes in company policy to make sure our employees can work in a safe, productive environment. \" Gregory picks up his projection screen clicker and hits it. The title for the powerpoint presentation is called \" Human Interaction in the Workplace and the Legal Homicide Act. \" Gregory turned to the group. \" As many of you know, killing recently has become rampant, and government legislation is beginning to roll out addendums to the law inhibiting where murder can occur. Until the law is corrected, murder is technically legal in the workplace. We at T G Partners have come to the general consensus that the fear of murder and conspiring to murder are unproductive ways to spend company time. \" Gregory hits his clicker and brings up the second slide: \" Interaction amongst coworkers. \" Greg continued, \" Policy will change to reflect the law, and T G Partners will not condone the conspiracy of murder or the act of murder in the workplace. \" Living in fear that one of your coworkers is plotting to kill you can interrupt workflow. To protect your interests as an employee, conspiring to kill someone you work with will be a punishable offense, \" Greg interrupted his presentation, reread the next portion of what he has written down, and continued, \" If you have already submitted to kill someone in the office, it is mandatory that you consult your HR representative to resolve the issue in the best interests of both parties and the company. \" He paused to let the statement sink in. Someone coughed. He continued, \" Likewise, if you heard that someone is plotting to murder you, you can contact your HR supervisor and then we will make an appointment to sit both parties down to see if the issue can be resolved in a productive manner. \" Gregory hit the next slide: \" Murder outside the workplace. \" \" We can not influence your actions outside the workplace. However, policy will be changed to reflect the use of time off. If you mean to kill someone and are thinking about using accrued vacation time to do so, then that action is permitted. \" Greg turned the page of his notes. \" However, you can not take sick time off to murder someone. If it comes to the attention that you lied about a sickness to murder someone, that will count as a punishable offense and there will be consequences. As always, if you are sick, please bring in a doctors note. \" Greg thought for a moment about something he wanted to add. \" Likewise, you can not use bereavement time off to kill someone, either. \" Phillip raised his hand. A couple of the other administrators turned to him and then back to Greg. Greg pointed to Phillip and asked, \" Do you need clarification on these points? \" \" Yes. Let's say that during your off time, you wanted to kill someone that worked in the office, and they were out of the office too, is that against company policy? \" Following his question was the shifting of feet, and a loud laugh from Hank in sales. Phillip immediately regretted his hypothetical question. Greg stared at Phillip for a moment and then looked at the other HR representatives. They looked at Phillip and then back to Greg without answer. Greg thought momentarily and then answered, \" Technically, you are free to do what you want during your free time, but why would you want to kill one of your coworkers? \" Phillip began to sweat, clicking his pen rapidly. He answered, \" I don't want to kill anybody. I just thought the policy needed clarification. \" Hank from sales chimed in, \" Look out everybody, we got Ted Bundy working in accounting. \" Everybody laughed. Greg smiled, and turned to the HR reps who were not smiling, then turned to Hank, \" Knock it off, Dexter. \" Everybody laughed harder. Greg smiled harder, then continued. At the end of the meeting, Phillip was approached by Kim Walsh, one of the assistant managers. \" Hey Phillip, how has your first month been? \" She asked, nursing a cup of coffee. Phillip smiled politely at her and said, \" It has been great. Everybody in the department has been wonderful and I'm learning so much. \" \" Great. How's Aaron? \" \" Aaron's great. He and I had lunch at Banditos the other day. \" \" Okay, great, \" She gave him a slap on the shoulder, \" Keep up the good work. \" After speaking with Phillip she walked over to Gregory and the other HR representatives. Phillip found Aaron, talking to Hank. \" Does everyone think I'm a murderer now? \" He asked his acting supervisor. Hank laughed again. Aaron smirked, sympathizing with the uninitiated newbie of the office culture. \" Nobody thinks you're a murderer. You are probably in the periphery of HR right now though. I wouldn't doubt that you will be requested to have an additional appointment with them soon. \" After work, Phillip drove home with a pit in his stomach, knowing he just jeopardized his job. He checked the mail, hoping to find a letter stating that someone was going to put a bullet in his head tonight. He walked his dog, went back in, and buried his face in a couch cushion for an hour. He checked his work email, finding no request from HR for the appointment. He refreshed his email every hour until dinner.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 83, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Forewarning: this came to be a rather dark interpretation of the prompt. It is perhaps something that only makes sense to me, but still, I'll post it. It is, in a way, a summary of how I've felt about my past as I recover from depression, and how much this disorder can change the way you percieve your own memories. Or, maybe it's just a piece of writing. Falling. There is really no way to describe those few moments after the jump. It should only have taken a second to reach the bottom, and yet it felt to me like full minutes, hours even, may have passed. The instant I jumped, I was filled with relief. The decision had been made. I was no longer at war with myself, no longer struggling to keep myself tethered to the world. As I fell, in true cliqued style, my life flashed before my eyes. Half-remembered memories of early childhood suddenly flooded my mind. My parents, proudly waving as I happily bounced by on a pony at the beach. My brother, clasping my hand and laughing hysterically as he tried to teach me how to skate, my tiny legs flailing madly just to stay upright. Early family holidays, childhood friends, elaborate games whose rules made sense only to myself and my brother. Memories of innocence, too early to be tainted by sadness. I watched myself grow, learn, play, laugh my way through childhood. Then memories of adolescence, those confusing, messy teenage years, began to resurface. My first love, my first kiss, and, soon after, my first heartbreak. Countless evenings with friends, wandering the town carefree and with no aim. The petty family arguments, characterised by an angry silence followed by a half-hearted apology on my part and complete forgiveness on that of my parents. Memories of a carefree time, a time of irresponsibility and unhindered fun. Then, my adult life came into the spotlight, short as it was. Those moments of excitement as my life changed; as I moved out, graduated, fell in love, married. Memories of happiness, excitement, worry, achievements and failures, old friendships lost and new ones made. This is not the life I remember. These are the memories of a life well lived, and yet still I'm here, falling. Surely this man, whose life just played out in an instant, could not be the one who took such drastic action as to jump? How could my thoughts, my memories, have been skewed so much by my own mind? This has not been the life of someone with nothing to live for - and still, I fall.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 84, "lang": "en"}

A whole where the pain should be, a space for me to store my sadness and my happiness, and let them fight to see who rules me today. But they've both left. I can feel where I should feel it, but it doesn't help. That hole is all there is now, by the time I even noticed it was there I had already been completely swallowed by it. Why would I try and climb out? It's not comfortable down here, but it's easy. I think about suicide, never seriously enough for concern. I'm not going to kill myself because what would be the point? Those I cared about would be affected, but they would get by, not without their scars, but those fade. I'm not dead, but I know I'm not alive, death would be redundant. There are days though, days where the faintest glimmer of light pierces the darkness. I could play a game that stirs something, or a movie that I can't tear my eyes from. It can even be as simple as a passing glance or word. Where I move my eyes from the darkness to see the thinnest glimmer of..... something. Is it hope? I don't know, don't much care to.

{"text": "The wind was rustling my hair and I felt as though I was floating in the sky, everyone thing seemed fine while I was asleep except for the fact that the wind seemed to be rustling my hair too roughly and instead of floating it was though as I was falling off wherever I had laid down. Wait a minute! Where am I? My eyes were still closed and I had my hands tucked behind my head as I try to remember where I was and how I got wherever I was. First I was with John and we just got outfitted with new clothes fit for combat and style and we were just about to jump through the portal to the planet that was causing all the problems on Earth. That's it! I'm on that new planet! But wait, I don't remember entering the portal yet. Hmm..... O shit! Now I remember Alex knocked both of us out, the bastard! He was always like that to us, we couldn't get him back either with him being apart of God and everything. So I should probably open my eyes right now, but it feels so good right now. I sigh as I finally take my hands off of my head and finally open my eyes only to see an empty clear blue sky. He dropped us in the sky?! The fucking sky?! This is gon na hurt I though to myself. I turned to face the earth, seeing a deep green forest, a sea, and a coastline town. Hmm that should be as good a spot as any. I pulled my arms and legs in plummeting even faster to this foreign planet. Alex told us that he had already sent a couple hundred scouts earlier, scattering throughout the planet preparing for our arrival. The people here also seem to have a developed cultures similar to Earth and even spoke some form of English, Alex said it was apparently due to some people from Earth finding and entering portals to this world. Hope I land in a land that speaks English or Chinese I thought to myself as I drew closer to the sea. \"Here's Jonah!\" I bellowed as I broke into the water with a thundering sound. Is it a bit too exaggerated of an entrance? Maybe, but is it any less epic? Hell no. I returned back to the surface with a gasp and a hardy laugh possibly scarring the two men on a small row boat that I had just noticed. They were possibly father and son as both resembled one another and were definitely wet as they were drenched from head to toe still holding on to what looked like fishing poles but were already broken. The father finally spoke \"A-a-are you a g-g-god?\" He was shaking whether that was from the cold or fear was hard to distinguish. \"Uhm no hahaha.\" I lied (about being a mortal) \"I'm just a man, falling from the sky, possibly braking the sound barrier who was just trying to take a nap.\" I gave him my best smile but from the looks of it he probably wouldn't bite the bait (Hahaha see what I did there?) \"Good enough for me pa\" The younger one spoke, he was probably around my age 16 or 15 \"Now let's git ya outa there, ya must be freezin.\" He stretched out his hand. At least there aren't trying to kill me, that's always a good thing, most of the time. I grabbed his hand as I try to get on their fishing boat, his father quickly came to help. \"Thanks\" I said to them while I was looking around, the father seemed to have noticed and asked \"Ya lost sumthin'?\" a small amount of sarcasm and a tiny laugh in the question. I looked into the sky and saw it finally, first only being a small red line in the vast sky it slowly became larger as it got closer (as most things falling from the sky tend to do) The two sharing puzzled glances at one another. It finally slammed into my hand as the force nearly yanked me off of the boat, uh-oh this might be bad need to put some particles on the boat, feeling the small amount of power well up within me and stick to the boat and the other two. The force was indeed strong pulling both me and now the boat several meters from where we were before. The two both repeatedly switched their sights between me, their feet, and the thing in my hand. \"Wha- How the father managed to spit out before his son simply asked in a loud manner \"What in the gods is that thing?\" pointing to the long object I held \"Never seen a long di I caught my self \"I mean this is my staff, I don't think I'v introduced myself I'm Jonah Wulong, at your service.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 87, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "The main pub in my hometown looked exactly as it always had; like a brick and shingle funeral home with a coat of paint, some sputtering fairy lights and the gaudy flash of idling gaming machines in one corner. It probably had been a funeral home in the past for all I knew - or perhaps that was all the architect knew how to design. This wasn't exactly the kind of town that nurtured creative talent - our chief exports were abusive alcoholics, infanteers, solo mothers, B-grade rugby players and retired farmers. It was the sort of place that once you left, you rarely admitted to being born there. It wasn't just the pub that hadn't changed, most of the same storefronts were there. The greasy spoon burger place, the ancient department store steeped in nepotism and the faux cultured cafe run by farmer's wives who didn't know a latte from a mochaccino. Another supermarket had opened up - the facade plastered with grinning white people in'towny' clothes, holding biodegradable grocery bags full of luxuries that most of the benefit-bludging populace couldn't ever afford. That this place was still gasping along on life support since I escaped it fifteen years ago was nothing short of a miracle. My pace quickened and the pub approached faster. The memories of this place were not pleasant. Shaun was waiting for me inside the pub wearing the uniform of the locals - woolen jersey over a popped-collar rugby shirt, steel-capped workman's boots and faded blue Levis. While his face had grown leathery and premature grey streaked his temples, his haircut was still exactly the same as the day I'd left - short back and sides, just like dad. The air was hazy with cigarette smoke - the proprietor didn't care much for'city laws' against smoking indoors - and loud sporting channels chattered over the big screen TVs hung around the bar. I yelled out to Shaun, but he didn't hear me over the din of story-telling farmers, racing commentary, clinking pint glasses and the roar of trucks on the main road outside. Male gazes in various states of insobriety tracked me as I threaded my way through the tables. In this place I was an anomaly; an attractive young'towny' woman in'fancy' clothes and'whore' makeup. Scathing glares from rawboned and sun-damaged wives raked every high-heeled step toward my brother. \"Shaun,\" I called again. He saw me this time. At first he looked at me like any of the other locals - an object of both lust and derision - but as recognition dawned, a grin broke out and he slapped the bar in surprise, \"Matthew!\" I winced. That was a name I hadn't heard in person for over a decade. \"Hey,\" I husked, nervously, \"how are you holding up?\" \"Glad you came,\" he replied, serious now, \"I didn't think you'd bother.\" I shrugged, perching on a sticky bar stool and putting my handbag on the equally sticky bar top. \"I thought it was important to see him off. What time is the funeral tomorrow?\" Shaun gestured to the waitress and held up two fingers. She quickly filled two pints for us. \"Midday. The family from up north should be here around ten.\" The waitress paused, smiling at me, \"Oh wow, I love your nails, where did you get them done?\" \"I do them at home, I'm a pretty big nailpolish addict.\" She gave Shaun a sly smile, \"So introduce me to your lady friend, Shaun.\" He blushed, \"Shit Charlene, this ain't my girlfriend, this is Matty, don't you remember him at highschool?\" My stomach lurched as her smile faltered, then fractured. \"Oh,\" she managed, \"you're the tranny brother.\" As she scurried away, I fixed my brother with a disappointed glare, \"Jesus Christ Shaun! It's been fifteen years and you still can't use my legal name.\" He said nothing, just sat looking shamefaced. \"It was mum, wasn't it? With her'You were baptised Matthew and you'll always be Matthew' bullshit. And you and dad just towed the fucking line like you always have.\" \"You didn't have to live with her,\" he griped. \"Well neither did you.\" We sat in silence for a few minutes; I drained my beer, then headed for the bathroom. \"Need to use the ladies, be back soon.\" The cowgirl and cowboy toilet signs guided me to the facilities, but the waitress and one of the burly locals blocked my path to the doorway with the pigtailed stick figure. \"Faggots aren't allowed in the ladies room,\" growled the thuggish farmhand. The waitress looked suitably smug. Then Shaun was there, right in the guy's face. \"Look man, he might have been born a guy but he's got all lady parts now - he went to Thailand and everything.\" I sighed, \"Forget it Shaun, I'll use the mens room. Failing that, I'll piss on the back tire of someone's truck outside.\" Pushing past the locals, I shoved open the cowboy door and headed for the single stall.

{"text": "Her dreams began, like many dreams began in those days, with hearing a song. Allison McLaughlin was on her way with her parents to the Tennessee Valley Fair when she encountered an old man with a battered electric guitar and 10 watt amplifier, ringing out harsh bar chords and screaming some sort of strange mystical words about the working man and harsh ways of live in the country. The very sound of each note felt as if it was like a presence had encapsulated her to remain there. After the man finished his performance, he slung the guitar against his back and relaxed himself for a moment. Allison walked closer to the man, reaching into her pocket to find a couple paper bills to hand to him. \"That was incredible,\" Allison began with amazement. \"Where did you learn that?\" The older man peered at her with curiosity. Allison felt as if the gave in his pale blue eyes was scanning right through her. \"It's an old riff passed down for generations. It's simply feeling it for yourself.\" He explained esoterically, lifting the guitar off of his shoulders. Allison leaned forward. The old man handed her the guitar. \"You can try it out if you'd like.\" As Allison held the guitar she felt something manifesting inside her. She could feel the sound of the instrument flowing through her. It wasn't a simple instrument to make music, there was an even greater power from within it. Teaching her a chord progression of C-F-G, the old man began to yell some lyrics madly. When the song ended, Allison returned the guitar to the man, who put it into the hard case beside him. \"Music,\" he said solemnly. \"Sounds to soothe the soul with. Your playing really knows how to heal a person's spirits.\" He shook her hand and left her a business card. \"Lessman's Lessons, Memphis\" was the name printed on card. She thanked him. \"If you ever want to learn to play, come here. I will teach you myself.\" Lessman grabbed his case and began to walk down the street. During the valley fair, Allison could not take her mind off the old man and the guitar. Despite the musicians playing at the festival, none of them touched her the way the old man's playing did. It was something completely different. She looked at the card given to her. She had to take guitar lessons in Memphis. After the festival had ended, the days had passed, and Allison booked a bus to Memphis. She walked around town seeking out the music store listed on the address. It was nowhere to be found. She checked her phone, and the maps did not show any location with the address. She asked people passing by on the street, many whom have never heard of such an establishment and assumed she was trying to be funny. The afternoon was setting, and Allison sat on the ground in a nearby park. There was no hope after all. A busker was playing a rendition of Tom Waits on a standup bass in the park, despite there being nobody around. As he finished the rendition, his eyes had met Allison's and he approached her. \"The clouds look like they are gathering. A storm's coming. Are you all right?\" Asked the busker. \"I came here looking for a musician, but I can't seem to find him.\" Allison replied somberly. \"Memphis is the birthplace of Rock n Roll. There are many musicians.\" Explained the busker. He outstretched his hand. \"My name is Taylor.\" \"Allison,\" Allison responded, shaking Taylor's hand. \"His name is Lessman. He's a blues musician.\" Taylor stopped and returned his hand. He stared directly at Allison. \"Lessman is brilliant! I will take you to him!\" Exclaimed Taylor with glee. Allison, figuring that there is no better alternative, began to walk along with Taylor and his hefty standup bass across the streets of Memphis until the reached a small shack between crowded buildings nearby the music hall of fame building. The shack was barely the size of a small cabin and probably would go completely unnoticed from the outside. Approaching the door, Taylor tapped a cadence against the handle. A young man with dreadlocks and sunglasses answered the door. \"Good evening Taylor, and...\" the doorman paused. \"Who might you be, miss?\" \"Her name is Allison. She is Lessman's upcoming protege.\" Explained Taylor. The doorman nodded and led them inside. Inside was the appearance of an old speakeasy nightclub during the middle 20th century. There was a long bar, and a dance floor with a grand piano as its center piece on a stage in the distance. The entire room must have been five times the size of the cabin outside, and the tables were filled with all sorts of people discussing in low hums amongst themselves. On a sign by the door it read \"Howard Lessman's Open Mic.\" \"Lessman will be here shortly,\" said the doorman. \"Feel free to find a seat and make yourselves at home.\" Taylor took over an empty table in the corner of the room and Allison followed. With barely enough time to order drinks, the lights began to dim and the stage lit up. Lessman arrived on the stage. \"Welcome all of you,\" began Lessman. \"The open mic is a chance for us all to show our skills and learnings to the musician community of America. As you know, times are changing around us, and the age of traditional instruments is slowly fading for electronic beats and rhythms, but there is still a sense of need for this energy. We are gathered to preserve this arcane art. Please enjoy, and if you have an instrument, perform.\" The audience cheered and the night began. One after another, musicians came onto the stage and performed pieces. There was a supernatural experience to a lot of them, and each instrument and style brought another form of magic to the entire experience. Finally when the last note played, many shuffled out. Lessman caught Allison and Taylor. \"Allison!\" he exclaimed. \"Good to see you!\" Allison clapped her hands. \"That was awesome!\" she said enthusiastically. \"When are you doing another one?\" \"This was the last open mic for a while.\" Lessman declared. \"Tomorrow I am leaving town.\" Allison looked down. Her entire trip was pointless after all. \"However,\" Lessman continued. \"I was hoping you would like to join me.\" \"Join you?\" Questioned Allison. \"I can't even play anything.\" \"Not yet, but you will.\" Explained Lessman. \"You are born with magical blood. Music is a key to your soul. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Howard Lessman, a wizard of The Note. A society of sorcerers who are able to use music to create the aural healing sensations of magic and non magic folk. But our people are dying out. Soon enough music will be nothing more than a production made in a bedroom.\" Lessman continued on behalf of the puzzled looks of Taylor and Allison. \"I would like you to accompany me on my tour to Portland. They say that Portland is the center of a musician's magical power, and it is the only place where there is a chance to save our music from the growing trend of electronic beats. After seeing how you handled my guitar the other night in Knoxville, I know there could not be any one better than you. I have a tour across the country, you will be able to learn quick enough, but I am leaving tomorrow.\" Allison looked down. \"I can't.\" She said defeated. \"I have a home, and family in Knoxville. I can't just leave.\" Lessman shook his head. \"That can be arranged. I have already sent a letter to your folks. As far as they know, you have gained a scholarship from a summer band camp. Now He began to close down the hall and collect his guitar case. \"Let's go now, St Louis is waiting for us.\" Allison hesitated for a moment, Taylor butted in. \"You're both leaving?\" Lessman looked to Taylor. \"You're coming with us as well. Busking during the day will be the best way to get bus fare.\" \"Bus fare?\" Asked Allison. \"You don't have a van?\" \"The wages of musicians have never been kind, even in the golden days decades ago.\" Replied Lessman. Taylor shrugged and accepted. He looked at Allison, who had also reluctantly decided to join along. Before the night was over, the three were headed on a bus to St Louis, which seemed nothing more to them than just another musical world away from their own.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 90, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Chijin hastened his team again. The barricade must be finished by sundown. If it's not, they would all die. The corpses of fallen friends and Devose from before memory would see to that. As he set about binding a pair of tree trunks together with his crew, Chijin glanced at the barrier. The Chosen Elf was twirling his arms in some arcane ritual, beyond the understanding of any non-Chosen. He looked away again. He'd simply have to trust the old man to get it done right. Nearby, the Elven Shiimaas were meditating, ostensibly to hone their minds before battle. Chijin wasn't buying it, but he was willing to let it go. Any one of those Elves was worth his entire company in battle. He'd allow them their laziness. And besides, the sunset was nearly upon them anyway. \"Men of Holtin. We do not owe these people, these dwarves, elves, goblins, and devose anything. On the contrary, they owe us. But we made a promise, and if we aim to collect, we must win this night.\" The men of Holtin stirred and shifted while the man spoke. Chijin thought them all fools. \"So remember why we're out here. Remember your families, your homes, or your gold if that's what matters to you. Muster your courage, and together we will hold this ground until the barrier falls!\" Chijin noticed, out of the corner of his eye, the Chosen had stopped his arm waving and was consulting with Gfendol. Neither looked pleased. He resolved to get in on the conversation. \"Soli, this barrier must fall!\" Gfendol was visibly shaking. \"Fen, it's too powerful. Even with blood sacrifices I could not breach it.\" The old Elf was drained, and it showed. His color was ghostly, and he was hunched over as if he was bearing a great weight. \"If thisss barrier can not fall...\" Chijin was loathe to continue, and instead trailed off. Failure meant death at this point. There was no other option. \"If it claims us, so be it. But keep trying, Soli. This is what you're here for.\" Chijin cocked his head, and listened. A moment before, he'd heard something. A moment later, all hell broke loose. Out of the surrounding woods, corpses came pouring out, intent on the make-shift barricade. All together, the Shiimaas rose, their armor assembling on them as they ran to the front. Their top of the line telekinesis was fully on display, then, with swords twirling a dance of death around them even as they used their liquid swords to carve large swaths of corpses out of the horde. Overtop of them, Devose rifles ate away at the edges of the horde. Chijin gathered his men, and they fortified the entrance. Nothing could be seen, then, but they could hear. The song of war had risen to a fever pitch. Screams, shouts, clangs and booms, and all manner of other noises. And then, almost comically, it all stopped. And with it, the constant hum of the barrier. Then, a booming voice as the barrier collapsed, proclaiming, \"You must not open the gates!\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 91, "lang": "en"}

Kor'a laughed, the engineer's extra chin wattle swinging back and forth under his cleanmask. \"Well, something is still alive here\" Kor'a grinned, squirting the grille with a can of Supa-Kleen universal fluid produced from one of his many pockets. \"Maybe there is actually something worth salvaging.

I told you this was worth checking out.\" Xe'l had discovered the structure on the prospecting scan of a minor planet of a minor system in a backwater galaxy purely by chance. the AI flagging it as a speculative source of water was a happy little accident. The water alone was worth billions of creds, but the crumbling stone box of the \"Sagan advanced physics research center\" whatever that was, offered a much finer prize. 58 cycles of drudgery, recovering broken escape pods crammed with emaciated crewmen and recovering drive cores from derelict cargo ships and finally providence had smiled on him. Here was something really special that the syndicate would pay big creds for. Selling functional alien tech on the black market could keep Xe'l and Kor'a knee deep in mel-fa for the rest of their lives. Three months and several thousand creds later, Xe'l and Kor'a finally made planetfall and excavated their way into the alien facility. Kor'a had finally cleared enough filth out of the long dormant speaker grille for the translator unit to pick out the words the alien machine was saying. \"Welcome to the Sagan advanced physics research center. Please present your security passes to the attendant.\" Xe'l glanced at the dessicated grinning head bones of one of the strange bipedal aliens propped up in the rusted skeleton of what was once a seat behind a scuffed and dusty pane of clear plastic. Somehow he doubted the attendant would be very interested in their clearance. \"Once clearance is granted, please follow the yellow line to the changing area. The security doors may be accessed by swiping your pass.\" Xe'l pushed the doors, barely more than waist high slabs of rust, wincing as they squealed and juddered open. Xe'l and Kor'a padded down the corridor, stepping over bones and shards of metal, barely making a sound in the charnel silence of the dead facility. Xe'l pointed to a heavy side door the scan unit chirruping harshly in the silence. \"The signals are coming from behind this door.\" he whispered. Ten minutes later Kor'a smiled with satisfaction as the primitive locking mechanism relented under his ministrations and the heavy door swung open. Long dormant lights flickered and shimmered to life in the cold, cavernous space. One popped loudly, showering sparks onto the cracked and crumbling concrete flooring, quickly extinguished by puddles of green and scummy water. \"Can you feel that vibration Kor?\" Xe'l murmered. \"This thing is still active, sure enough.\" replied Kor'a, a hushed awe in his voice. \"Let's see what we have then.\" Kor'a produced a phase wrench from his belt and started levering at a promising looking panel. \"Uh.

It's a word.\" I smirk triumphantly as I put down the tiles for my triple-word-score word, putting me 64 points ahead of the other players dumbfounded at my success. David, my father and our scrabble group's dictionary holder, gives a sigh. \"It's a word,\" he reluctantly admits, \"a small weevil apparently.\" I pick out the last seven tiles of the game - K, W, Y, J, B, I, O - and give an inward groan. Messing with time like this gives me such a headache. At first I'd only add small words. Qi, zi, zu - idiotic point earners because I used to be terrible at scrabble. My dad's a two time champion of the North American Scrabble Championship, and damned if he'd let his kid grow up as a disappointment. But I was a disappointment, I won only once every dozen games but that got me hooked. I dropped out of university to play more often, and since I was failing my physics degree I didn't care anyway. But I was terrible, and my vocabulary was too. That gave me an idea. So, with a microwave with no door, a cell phone and a TV, I created a time machine - quite by accident, but that's irrelevant. Future gadget no. 8 I called it, now 1-7 being stupid things I'd made with a university friend and computer hacker. And, with a bunch of made up words, I began winning matches. People would accuse me of cheating, but of course they were all there in the dictionary. My dad stopped thinking of me as a disappointment after that and if I had to cheat to make my dad look favourably on me, it was worth it. Besides, what's the harm? \"Excuse me,\" I tell the group around the table as I head into the kitchen. Setting the microwave to 120 seconds, I enter the letters onto my phone. \"Kwyjibo.\" \"Kwyjibo?!\" I smile smugly as I lay down the last tiles of the game.

{"text": "Paul was at the end of the line as his class filed off the bus. Paul was a quiet kid. He didn't have many close friends, but it was impossible to deny that his classmates liked him. His teachers always noted how kind he was to his classmates and was very mature for his age. He had to be. He lost his father two years ago. It was tough for any child to endure, especially for Paul, who had always been close to his father, and now was left with his mother and two younger sisters. It was in that hospital, after watching his father struggle for years with pancreatic cancer, that Paul first noticed a red circle. He had never realized what it meant.... no one else in the room had seen it, and Paul had mostly ignored it. His father had died, the world felt like it had stopped spinning..... why worry about some stupid red circle. Paul lifted his head as he got off the bus. It was a good thing that he was at the end of the line, because he stopped right in his tracks. A sea of red spots was laid out before him. He cautiously approached the border of the observation area and gripped the wall. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of red circles laid out before him across the wide field. Paul looked to his classmates, none of them seemed to have noticed the surreal sight before them. \"This,\" his teacher said loudly, drawing the attention of the students, \"is the sight of the final leg of the battle of Brownfield. It is estimated that somewhere between 1400 and 1600 soldiers lost their lives in this field on the final day of the battle. Around 1000 of those deaths were Confederate soldiers, and with their forces this depleted, the Union was able to seize control of several important railways. This allowed them to...\" and the teacher continued. But Paul had stopped listening. He finally understood. The red circles meant death. That was the only explanation. He was overwhelmed, and was able to think of little else the rest of the day. The class traveled around various different sites, and each time, Paul was amazed by the red circles that seemed to appear in every place they visited. One place they didn't appear was in the museum. Even then, Paul was haunted by what he had seen, and it wasn't until the bus ride home that Paul was able to close his eyes, and try to forget what he had seen. Paul was silent at dinner that night. That was not completely unusual, and Paul's mother knew that talking of death all day at the battlefield had probably reminded Paul of his father. Paul sat quietly as the kids worked on their homework after dinner, and as soon as he had finished, asked his mother if he could go to bed. As Paul got into bed that night, he laid up at the ceiling for a long time. He finally understood the red circles. The question that he didn't even know he wanted answered had been resolved. Unfortunately, this did not answer the questions that had been circulating in Paul's head since he got home that night. If these circles were the spots where people died, why could no one else see them? And why, Paul thought as goosebumps crept onto his arms, were there 8 red spots in a perfect circle in his backyard?", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 94, "lang": "en"}

No, plants grow on their own for the most part, but the growth is not the only part of His plan. Weeds, you understand, are also part of His creation. They are the sole feature of the garden of hell. When we abandoned Him, the decay of hell crept into our world, and gave us death, disease, poverty, and sin. Before the fall, there were no gardeners, only gardens.

After you apologized, and said that you were just messing around and didn't mean anything by what do guys did, I knew that was bullshit. I looked you right in the eyes and I didn't want to look away, I saw exactly what you were thinking, because I was thinking it too.

I've never felt so emasculated, so small. I tower over both of you, I exercise, I work out, I play rugby.

{"text": "Growing up I'd always had these nightmares. Swirling fire and ash around a group of sick people, never burning them, while shadowy figures danced beyond the light of the fires. They stopped when I turned 18, as I was told they would. Had I been smarter, or had a Dream Reader bothered to analyze them, perhaps the world could have been saved. I remember the anticipation on the big day, and the dread from the weeks leading up to it. It was a popular week for birthdays, probably because of a huge music festival that came through town 18 years and 9 months before. That was the town joke, anyways. There were 100 kids turning 18 that week at my school alone. Only 20 showed obvious powers, the rest were really subtle or minor...... Or incredibly embarrassing. My friend Joe could turn invisible, but only while his dick exposed to light. That caused a lot of problems in the men's locker and restrooms for a couple weeks at school. Tim could fly for 5 minute periods, which was pretty cool. Jason could remember anything he read, except he'd remember it in Spanish, no matter what language he originally read it in. Kristy was the last in our class aside from me to exhibit her power, a month after our birthdays. She can make weeds grow, like really grow. She was arguing with her sister, got angry, and a giant dandelion grew right through the kitchen. I knew I had to be something special, something awesome, and that's why I hadn't shown any powers yet. My mom is a telepath, but she didn't figure it out until she was almost 19. My dad claims to be a pyrokinetic, but I've never seen him use it. My sister, Megan, got her powers at 17. She can walk on walls, but only from 10 feet up; from ground to 10 feet she's stuck like the rest of us. It's weird. Whoever decides who gets what has a weird sense of humor. So a month goes by, summer arrived, and I still had nothing to show aside from the occasional hot flashes and a bad case of allergies that had come and gone consistently. But things started happening around town. First people started to get sick with a weird cold that would last a few days, sometimes accompanied by a rash on their arms. Then these things started happening, beginning with the movie theater. Alabama Weedwacker Massacre 17 was playing. Nobody saw what happened, the attendants walked in to clean up and found everyone dead, ripped apart as if by wild animals, the smell of burned hair and sulphur filling the room. People who were in neighboring theaters claim hearing the screams from the room, but didn't think anything of it because it was a horror slasher. They told themselves it was normal to scream during a horror movie, but I don't think it helped them sleep at night. A week later security cameras caught a giant sinkhole open in the street in front of the coffee shop we all used to hang out at. It spouted fire, burned a few things, set the shop on fire, then collapsed on itself. The authorities called it a stray methane pocket. The next day people found the bodies of a group of kids from school ripped apart in the park. They were all jerks, bullies mostly who sold drugs and stole lunchmoney, but that's a brutal way to go. The third floor of the hospital just vanished a couple days after that, everyone gone with no trace. Only that sickly sweet hospital smell of ammonia and bleach, mixed with sulphur and burned hair. As June turned to July, the CDC was called in, and the town quarantined. Researchers discovered that 1 in 20 people who got sick from the disease developed a mutation that resulted in a high fever, followed by death. They were literally cooked from inside. An event followed the death between 48-72 hours after. It spread faster than we understood what was happening. Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York, London........ by November every major nation was reporting incidents, by January it has spread to smaller countries. And every place people started to get sick, some to die, things happened. The faint smell of brimstone and burnt hair, torn bodies, sinkholes of fire or volcanic ash..... The occasional report of a sighting, something crawling out of the sinkhole or a beast's shadow in a window before everyone vanished..... Now we know that the mutation is similar to the genetic changes exhibited by the high level teleporters, people whose superpowers include cross world or transdimensional travel through parallel universes. The popular theory now is that when infected die, it creates a door to another dimension that these...... creatures, come through. And the first time I saw them, I knew. I recognized them from my dreams as a kid, the shadowy figures dancing beyond the fires. I never got the illness, even though everyone in my school and family eventually did. I never developed any noticeable power. They said the disease was transmitted through bodily fluids...... it started with my getting allergies the first time after turning 18. My friends all got sick then, but not me. I was Patient Zero, the carrier for a disease from another dimension. I destroyed the future of the world, opened the doors for creatures from hell to invade and kill us......", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 99, "lang": "en"}

I won't have this business go down in flames because we can't get a few knights in shining armor through the gates. If we take a little from each chamber we should be able to still function.

But what....\" Then from the corner of the room, a small voice spoke up. It came from Fangor, a demon servant to the Dark Lord. \"My lord....have you considered an outside hire?\" The voice vanished as softly as it had come. Fangor was the smallest of his demon brothers and was made well aware of it. \"Why you...\" Barowyn raised his staff as it started to glow a deep crimson. \"How dare you enter his Dark Lord's chambers uninvited! I will cast you back to the pits from which you came!\" Just as Barowyn was about to strike, Malucin jumped in front of it and absorbed the blow, a mere itch to him. \"Stop Barowyn! The little imp may have a point. It's at least the one sensible idea that has been spoken this entire meeting. You there, demon.

{"text": "Okay, I know what you're thinking. You think I'm crazy, don't you? Well, let me tell you something I'm not, okay? I'm not crazy. I may be in a straightjacket in a mental hospital, and my story may be considered strange, but it's true. It's true and I'm not crazy. Here, here's my story..... I'm sure most of the doctors here would start right in the middle of my tale, where I committed my crime. That's probably why it is so easy for people to call me crazy. After all, they're psychologists, not storytellers! Heh. Anyway, to stop delaying, here's the beginning. This tale probably started about two years ago, when I first got the apartment. I loved that place still do, despite what happened. It was pretty cheap while still in a good neighborhood, and my neighbors were all pretty nice. Hell, I'm probably going back when I get out of here. Anyway, my neighbors were great, especially Barry next door. He'd regularly come over every Friday and we'd unwind after the tiring week with alcohol. One time, we got so st-faced drunk that we were both hanging off the fire escape like rabid chimps and we yelled out comments of foul nature to every member of the opposite sex. Barry, at one point, saw a girl walking down the sidewalk in a tight black dress and gave the \"cunnilingus\" signal to her. It was hilarious. But, everyone, no matter how good a person is, has at least one flaw. His? His fault was..... well..... he farted. Now, I know this sounds insane. After all, a person of \"rational\" means would think that is a very strange motive for my crime, but you have not seen his contorted face as his bowels erupted in a chorus. You have not heard the thunderous bang, like an atomic bomb exploding in the Senoran Desert. You have not smelled..... oh dear God you have not SMELLED..... imagine spoiled milk shoved into the stomach of a dead person, along with sulfur, manure, and firecrackers set to explode at any second. The aftermath of said explosion is the smell of one of his lesser bursts of gas. Even still, the idea of my crime did not even come to mind until six months ago. I was over at his apartment, and we were both sitting on the couch playing one of those sports games. After a session (I won), Barry stood up and asked if I wanted a beer. I answered favorably, and as he turned to the kitchen, his as erupted in a sharp boom of a form of gas so terrifying, it should be labeled as a weapon of mass destruction. Even worse, the blast was aimed right into my face. No words could possibly describe the pain and horror that coursed through my body. The sound sent shockwaves through my body, making my organs jump and shrivel. The smell raped my nostrils and invaded my body, ripping and tearing into nerves and muscles like a flesh-eating virus. The immense pain flowing through me was topped only by the shrill yell that escaped my lips and the hysterical laughing that came from Barry. It was at that moment, when the offending, ghastly blow echoed through my body, with the source of my pain laughing right into my face, that I realized what I must do. I had to kill him. But while my first thought was to kill him right there and then, I knew that I couldn't when he was aware, he could easily either stop me or make enough noise so that others would be alarmed and call the police. No, I knew I would have to wait. I waited and planned, planned and waited, for six grueling, agonizing months. If there was any clue of my sanity, it is that an insane man would not have waited that long, and would have sloppily killed Barry and then prance in public in a sunflower-designed dress with \"I did it\" spray-painted on it. But I did not do that. I would not do that. I am a sane, patient man. Besides, I don't even have spray-paint. Heheh. Anyway, it all came together just a few months ago. I waited until 2 AM, when everyone on my floor was either deep asleep or long gone for night-time adventures. I crept down the hall, so slowly, so silently, to Barry's apartment. I took from my pajama pant pocket a copy of Barry's key in my hand. If you are wondering how I obtained such an item, it was because I house-sited for him several times during my two-year tenure in that building, when Barry went on vacations. Back to that night, I slowly opened the door, so that nothing could disturb the room, to cause Barry to stir from his slumber. I just as slowly closed the door and set my way to Barry's bedroom. There he was, the bd. Sleeping with a silly smile on his face, as poised straight up. I quietly snuck into the room, one foot softly gliding over the other, until I made it to his bed. When I got right next to his bed, I took a pillow that was under him and quickly pulled it off. I saw him start to stir so I quickly jumped on him and put the pillow over his face. He squirmed, he moved, he even tried to scream under the muffling cotton. His hands flailed, trying to grab onto me so that he could pull me off. His legs flailed and tried to kick me. All of that was to no avail. I killed him. I killed the bd. The plan has gone completely right. Or, that's what I thought, until his rump gave a final goodbye to the world. I forgot that when someone dies, they instantly piss and st themselves. From his as, erupted a foul explosion akin to an old-fashioned cannon. I truly believe that the sound shook the very foundations of the apartment. When the fart started to give away, leaving only small bursts, I take out the hammer and use the pulling side to start taking away nails at on the floor. When enough of them were taken away to make a hole, I quickly grabbed the body and dropped it into the hole. After I nailed the boards back together, I let myself relish in what I had done. I have gotten away with murder. Then Mr. and Mr. Jones came in. \" We heard an explosion! What's going on? \" One of the Mr. Jones'yelled. Now, most would quiver at this point and give up. But I didn't. I pulled the perfect crime. I ran with it. \" Yeah! I heard it too! I thought it came from here, so I ran out to see what's going on! \" Suddenly, I heard it. A sharp release of gas. I look at the two, thinking one of them might be the culprit, but their faces gave nothing away. \" Did you see anything? \" The other Mr. Jones asked. \" No, I just ran in here and found nothing. \" It happens again. A wet explosion. \" Uh...not that I mean to pry, but, why do you have your shoes on? \" Mr. Jones asks. Another explosion. \" Well, I, uh, I slipped them on really quick before heading out. Yeah. \" I said. I heard another explosion. My heart was starting to beat quicker. I felt sweat coming down my brow. \" But your shoes are tied. You must be very quick at tying your shoes. \" Another explosion. Another. My head started to throb. \" Well, I, uh, I, I already, uh, kinda had them on! Yeah. Already had them on. \" \" Why? \" Another explosion. \" Uh. I had some, uh, errands to run. \" \" At 3 in the morning? \" \" Yeah! \" The explosions were becoming quicker, more persistent, yet somehow even louder, fouler smelling. My head felt like it was being crushed in. My eyes started to water. I felt my stomach start to churn and I would give anything just to be away. I would have rather been dead then to feel like that. The explosion - The Jones. They knew. They must know! They had to have heard the explosions, they must have! They knew. They knew what I did! But they won't admit it. They want a confession out of me! My interrogators must have noticed my sweating, heaving state. One of them lightly placed his hand on my shoulder. \" Are you okay? \" I finally snap. \" No I'm not, you butt-humping Brady Bunch! You can stop now! I know what you're trying to do and I admit it! I admit it! I killed Barry! I suffocated him to death and buried him under the wood of the apartment! Tear away the wood - see the rapid explosions of his loud, deadly farts! \"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 103, "lang": "en"}

The Global Anthem played and immediately after a screen lit up in front of me. 2020 Global Election Citizen: Kayne West Please select your presidential nomination: [ ] Donald Trump [ ] Kayne West [ ] Hillary Clinton [ ] Vladimir Putin Billions of people would be seeing a similar screen today. The new Earth Voting Integrated Logistical system was now available globally and would be used for the first time in the world since the dawn of the Trump era. The Wall of 2016 turned out to be a pivotal moment in the history of mankind. When America isolated itself from the rest of the world, something unexpected happened. A Wall that started in America, quickly spread to Canada and Mexico. Before the walls were even finished in Canada, South America had already began preparing for their wall. In four short years, the walls engulfed all the countries in the world. And everyone was perfectly content. Business was booming. No more corruption, no more religion, no more racism. The world is now just a lean mean business machine. Stocks are at an all-time high and productivity is so efficient that the average worker only spends 10 hours a week at their job. Donald Trump did it. He brought the world together... and after this election was over, it would all be mine. I feel bad to do this to Donald, but he was always just a pawn in my master plan. I knew he was a genius like me, and that his rough around the edgestake no bullshit kind of attitude was just a front. I knew deep down that all he wanted was to be the man that created a global utopia. That's why I had to stop him. That's why when he approached me to write the Global Anthem, I didn't hesitate at the opportunity. What he didn't know, was that I programmed a subliminal message into the anthem that will cause the listeners to unconsciously and automatically vote for me or buy my products when they hear the Global Anthem.

I mean, I can not be the only guy in the world who is lacking a soul. An empty shell of a human being. A husk. A facade. A masquerade. So I turned my pockets out. Nothing. Checked under the couch, between the cushions. I found a few dollar coins that nobody uses and a couple of old business cards. I checked in the pantry. And under my bed. I searched in the closet. Things were starting to get hopeless. So I walked down to the corner bodega, bought a couple of bags of Lays chips. The extremely boring kind. I slammed them down on the counter. It crunched beneath my finger tips. After a few hours of searching and calling everyone I could think of I was starting to get really depressed. So I went to The Kiev. And ate breakfast. And as I was walking down 2nd Avenue, towards St. Mark's Place where all those people sell used books and other junk on the streets. I saw my soul lying there on a blanket, some guy was selling it. I had to buy it off him. He wanted twenty two bucks but I talked him down to seventeen. I took it home. Washed it off. And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete. People sometimes tell me I should get my soul permanently attached but I don't know. Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass.

Just a buddy. You want some meat?\" Cooing as I held the large steak aloft in front of me. The dragon eyed me warily, it's eyes constantly moving to the piece of meat. As if gauging the possibilities. These creatures were smart, too smart for anyone to truly be comfortable around, still, everyone had to be good at something and this just seemed to be my niche. Flinging the steak across the air towards the creature caused the presumed reflective action. It snapped its jaw into the air and snatched it mid flight. I continued. Feeding it more and more until it started to look at me as the source instead of the food. It watched me as I magically produced the meat, unbeknownst to the creature the sheer amount of downers that had been laced in the thing. \"Good girl.\" I cooed, taking a step closer only to be met with a hiss of hot air that blew my hat right off my head.\" Easy girl. Nothing to worry about.\" I took another step as it watched me warily. \"Right. Easy girl\" I said producing another piece of steak and flinging it at the thing.

{"text": "The door shut behind him and President Thomas Perez let out a sigh as he let his shoulders slump and returned himself to the bad posture he usually carried himself with. Ever since he had become the 45 th President of the United States just 6 days ago it seemed he was walking and standing everywhere with a more of a pronounced posture. \"A Presidential posture\" he thought chuckling to himself sadly. Alone now in his private quarters of the bunker he tried to relax for the brief 5 minutes before he was to address the nation. \"What's left of it.\" he found himself saying aloud. It had been six days of chaos. From the second the blast occurred he had been surrounded by at least a dozen men who didn't let him out of their sights. He had insisted that down here in a bunker, hiding like an animal as he saw it, that he could wield some of his authority and demand just five minutes of solitude. He was about to address the nation as their President for the first time since, the crude, but remarkably effective low yield nuclear device destroyed a swath of Washington as President Obama gave the State of the Union address. Taking with it the lives of 14000 people including every single other human being in line of Presidential succession. He was the Secretary of Labor a week ago when then President Obama tapped him to be the one person to not be in attendance at the address. He remembered the President winking at him and saying \"No worries Tommy, you'll be out of the bunker and back in the cabinet in no time\" He had been down here since shortly after the President made that little quip. A bunker 16 miles outside of DC that he was required to be in according to the laws of the the United States Government Continuity laws. \"How has it come to this? he said to the empty room. He knew things had gotten progressively worse in the last 5 years. Incredibly worse really. The Revolution had seemed to occur in escalating degrees of severity in its violence. Relatively peaceful protesters in lower Manhattan giving way to more violent and militant demonstrations.At first the policy of the administration had been to let the protests occur so as long as they weren't violent. The escalation of protester action and police reaction was steady for the next few years. There were more riots, each more violent and deadly then the previous. But then a higher watermark of unrest was set. A group of armed, masked men had ambushed and killed 10 NYPD officers on live TV. The national guard was called in. What followed a week later would be known as the start of the great insurrection. 500 armed and organized militant protesters engaged a battalion of the National guard. The battle raged for two weeks and took over 2500 Lives. The insurrection was quelled and, for a brief moment, it was thought all of the radical, militant factions had been killed or captured. But it was only the beginning. Reinforments of militants began coming in droves to Manhattan. Despite martial law set upon the entire city, thousands of angry and incensed citizens made there way to New York. What was once the fringe element of radical society was fast becoming the status quo. A poll of the nation found that the country perceived the putting down of the great insurrection to be a hallmark of a tyrannical government. The island of Manhattan and city of New York was the focal point and lightning rod of the second American Revolution. With the financial center of the western world in an open state of anarchy the world was thrust into a economic depression that crippled trade and ostracized and alienated the United States from the rest of World. A few weeks prior to last week's detonation the President had begun to receive intelligence reports from the NSA that the revolutionaries may have nuclear scientists in their ranks that could possibly construct a crude nuclear weapon. The administration, the NSA, and the domestic intelligence community certainly heeded the dire warnings but in the end underestimated and ultimately discounted the findings as \"improbable\" President Perez wondered how many governments and rulers in history had made similar underestimations resulting in their destruction. The French revolution came to mind. The American one as well. It was the hubris of the powerful and elite that blinded them from the masses with torches outside their gates. A knock came from the door and a secret service agent stepped in \"Its time Mr President. I'm to escort you to the broadcast room\" The president offered a curt nod of approval and walked into the hallway. He made his way to the podium with the fake wall behind it adorned with the presidential seal. He noticed the claw of the eagle depicted clutching the arrows on the seal. A symbolic testament that the nation was at war. \"Mr President, we are live in....3....2....1.....\" He straightened his back, stood upright, and put back his shoulders..... \"My fellow Americans...", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 111, "lang": "en"}

It was the vehicle that brought me to the prison of my despair. Be deceived not by it's lime green exterior or it's pleather seats, or it's..... \"Are you doing that goddamn dramatic monologue in your head again?\" \"No,\" I said. I tried to be convincing, but could not call upon my soul to fill my voice with the deceit of enthusiasm, of childish youth and love and life. My life was lost the moment the weekend ended. \"Yes you are,\" she argued. \"You're doing that stupid thing with your hand again.\" I watched as my fingers slowly slid down the glass window, raking at the beautiful world just beyond my reach. \"No I'm not.\" Clouds formed in the sky above me. Ephemeral marvels. Muses of creativity brought forth into the world by the life energy of Mother Earth herself..... and yet they remain far from me.

How did she know? \"Last time I did that you jumped out.\" \"No I didn't.\" \"Look,\" she sighed. \"You've only got four days of school this week. And then you can go to the beach or the park or play your stupid video games all weekend. Just please,\" and here she turned to look at me over her shoulder. \"No more of this Shakespearean tragedy stuff for, like, the ten minutes that I'm driving you to school.\" Shakespeare was a hobbling commoner, I thought to myself, as silently as I could. \"Or whatever the hell poet you listen to now.\" \"How do you keep reading my mind?\" I asked, furious. \"You pick it up at some point after pre-calculus,\" she said, nonchalantly as she backed her minivan in between two Fords. \"Now get out and actually do good for once. I don't believe in you, but I will whoop your ass if you make Ms. Mahoney cry again.\" \"Farewell, mother,\" I moaned, as I slid open the heavy steel door of my transport vessel. \"Don't make any more enemies,\" she said. \"Hello Adam,\" Jimmy said. He didn't actually say it. He nodded at me. But that's what it meant. He was waiting in front of the steps to our history class. \"Quiz today,\" he actually said said. \"Queen didn't share cake. Peasants cut her head off. That's all I read.\" \"To think, they make us suffer through this five days a week,\" I complained. \"They trap us like sheep, but with economy seating. They test us and bury us if we fail their quizzes. The French revolted because they weren't given cake. Cities were razed. Regicide committed in the name of freedom from oppression. And yet here we remain, subjects of daily abuse in the modern day. We should have burned this city to the ground by now!\" Jimmy shrugged. \"Our rage roared, day after day, as our oppression grew only stronger and more upsetting. The whole country should have been engulfed in the flames of our fury! And yet, even this city remained.\" Jimmy agreed. Or nodded, at least. But I knew what he meant. We were brothers, sworn not by blood but by mutual pain. I could listen to him speak for hours without him once uttering a word. His thoughts were open to me as such! He knew the oppression we suffer. He tastes my bitter tears as I listen to the anguish of his heart.

Every night before I'd go to bed my mom would walk me to the top of the hill behind my house and then lay there with me as she told me stories of witches that soared the skies above and traveled all across the world. I used to take it as a fantasy. Until one night. I was about 12, a few years after my mother had passed, I saw a silhouette of a woman in the sky high above me. She was propelled by something beneath her that closely resembled your traditional broomstick. The silhouette whizzed beneath the stars so elegantly, it was like watching art being created and erased simultaneously as she flew through the night sky. She had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen on a woman. I could actually make out the color of it. It was a pure golden blonde hue, magnificently streaking across her midnight blue canvas. Her curls flowed behind her as she traced across my vision into the empty space of the night, far above me and out of reach... I cried that night. Her hair was just like my mothers. I've been there every night since then extending my arm out to the universe. Palm open. Waiting for the girl.

Resurrect him so that he can lead us to the money of all the millionaires and billionaires!\" The bold proposal was quickly adopted, although nobody knew how to pay for it. America would never learn of the assassination. The ritual called for the sacrifice of a high-class bird like a peacock or a cockatoo, but the team felt that such exuberance would drive Bernie's spirit away, rather than bring it back. They settled on a salty landfill seagull. The ritual was a success, but there was an unforeseen set back. Bernie could not speak. He could only walk in the direction of unsigned executive orders and bills and sign them. Even worse, he remained completely motionless unless music was being played in his presence at all times. \"Well...\" Vice President Stein reasoned, \"We all know Bernie's been repeating the exact same talking points for decades. Its one of the things people like about him. Lets take clips from over the years, and lay them to folk music. We'll have Senator Warren draft the legislation and push it through congress while Bernie's unrelenting message is playing on loop.\" And so it was. It became an everyday norm in the white house, to be going about one's business, when distant music would start to penetrate the walls as the resurrected Sanders dance-walked through the halls. His voice echoing loudly: \"The top one percent of one percent!...\" \"The economy is rigged!...\" \"Corrupt campaign finance system!...\" The media marveled at his youthful endurance and new-found sense of rhythm. \"Its time to say healthcare is a right, and not a privilege!...\" \"Look up the YouTube clip on Bernie-Sanders-dot-com!...\" \"Wall-street's business model is fraud!...\" Dance lines of millennials formed behind him wherever he went.

{"text": "Every flap of her leathery wings cause the air to tremble as she soars across the mountains she calls home. Scales a burnished red, sunlight glints off her in scintillating patterns. The early morning mist dissipates in her wake as she glides over the plains, reveling in her dominion of this kingdom. She is well content in her domain, a large swathe of land dotted with the crude buildings of her two-legged cattle. At her shadow, one of the cattle cries out a warning to the others and they scatter. She dives, and breathes out a lick of flame, but her heart wasn't really in it, having eaten a wild goat earlier that day. She'd grown fat on their tributes of oxen and sheep, but sometimes she still snaps up a few of them just for variety's sake. The only thing bothering her is her meagre hoard back in her dragon's den, a deep crevasse carved deep into the mountainside. She'd scoured the plains and the settlements, had even fought off a couple of lesser drakes outside her domain for their own treasure, but in the end her trove was still unsatisfactory. A miserably small heap of silver and copper coins, a golden chalice and a suit of gilded armor. Nowhere near acceptable. As she flies over her domain, a gleam beneath the cloudbanks attracts her gaze. Turning, she sees a golden shine down below at the riverside. She dives down from the skies, ready to claim the prize for her own, only to spill air in surprise as the object revealed itself to be alive. It hadn't seemed to notice her yet, the sinuous serpentine thing drinking at her river. It had a lustrous mane and a pair of fine whiskers, which it was fastidiously cleaning in the clear waters below. A small pair of curled horns protruded from its mane. The creature was small, barely half her size. And it was covered in golden scales. After a while of lapping at the stream, the creature turns its head towards her. She blinks, uncertain for a moment. None of her prey had been so calm before. But uncertainty gave way to her desire to add to her small hoard, and she lunged from the skies, claws ready to rend at the intruder. No fire, for she did not want to damage her prize. But the wingless beast takes to the air, effortlessly climbing the thermals. She turns, snapping at its tufted tail. The creature coils in midair, twisting its snakelike body this way and that. Now it faced her rush head-on as she followed it into the skies, wings beating at the air. She startles as the creature leapt forward, uncoiling as it shot towards her even as she approached it. She exhales a breath of fire in surprise, but the flames washed harmlessly around the intruder as it clawed at her snout. She hisses in pain, droplets of acrid blood flying. Now she knows that the creature can't be hurt by her fire, she scorches the air with heavy gouts of flame, using the thermals to gain height on her opponent. She sees the creature twisting in the inferno, confused, uncertain as to where to move. She dives into the hazy blaze, ripping into the creature- -only to have it vanish in motes of light. She's puzzled now, rising from the smoke and circling it. Soon, the gusts from her wings blow the smog cloud apart. The creature nowhere in sight. She bellows, spewing heavy plumes of smoke in frustration. A shimmering in the air, a distortion lined in gray. Too late, the creature senses her coming and turns to flee. She catches up easily, and seizes its throat, shaking it back and forth. Moments later, the creature was still between her jaws as she flapped towards her cave. At last, she drops the creature to the ground, limp and lifeless. She's tired now, weary from the fight and wants only to rest. Hurling the golden carcass atop her hoard, she curls up, content once more.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 117, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Following the second knock the door forced itself open. Tall, firmly built, yet elegant. Matte black shell broken only by polished white markings primarily across its abdomen and its expressionless face. Two arms propped it up; two more pairs hung limply at its side. Looking into its large compound eyes the man saw only his haggard face now slowly twisting with terror. Two segmented antennae slowly reached down to his height and, with the greatest of care, caressed his face and neck. Once satisfied, they retreated back to their owner who now took a step forward. The man staggered back, fell; the sounds of the television lost on him. Filling his door way was man's final technological testament: the vesproid. Built to defend the biomechanical apiproids who were in turn built to replace the honey bees, the vesproids were machines born and grown from other machines. Created in the image of the Japanese giant hornet, they were normally golden yellow with black markings. However, the one that towered over the man was defective: it was marked as a bald-faced hornet. What's it going to do? Take me back and feed it to the larvae? The man knew the warmongering ways of the vesproids and their overzealous protection of the apiproids: many ecosystems had been entirely dominated by them and their underground hives. Hives brimming with soldiers ruled by intelligent queens. The man closed his eyes and lay motionless. He felt the warm, metallic hand of the vesproid grasp his shirt collar. Right for the neck, eh? Yet to his amazement the vesproid merely stood him up and let go. Hesitantly he opened his eyes and saw nothing in the doorway. Wait, what? Instead he found the hulking thing standing beside his old CRT television set, Law and Order no longer playing. Instead the channel was static. \" Don't break that, \" the man said, his own voice strange to him. The vesproid's antennae perked up a little, but otherwise she showed no interest. Placing her four free hands on the back of the television, magnets in her hand altered the CRT to form a single word in the static, HIDE Bewildered by the intelligence of the vesproid he failed to heed her warning. At once four faces broke through the brittle wood ceiling of his shack. Their faces were golden yellow and the man knew that the defective vesproid hadn't left her hive unnoticed. Three of the soldiers dropped into the shack and converged upon the defective unit while the man cowered in the far corner. He watched as the defective unit picked up his television set and threw it at the nearest soldier, stunning it upon impact. The second soldier then dived at her, likely aiming for her thorax. She caught the attacker by her head and, with her great mandibles, bit it off with a bright blue spark. Dropping the corpse she failed to dodge the first soldier and the two fell to the ground. The soldier attempted to pierce the defective unit with her stinger, but she proved to be too maneuverable. The defective unit flipped them and now she lay on top. With one well-placed jab of her stinger she pierced the soldier's abdomen, killing it instantly. About to stand, the third soldier leapt on her back. The two wildly wheeled about to the center of the room. Nearly about to have her own head twisted off, the defective unit straightened herself and at once a pair of great iridescent wings exploded out from her thorax, slicing the piggy-backing soldier into a smoking mess. Abruptly the wings dissipated and she staggered forward. From his corner all the man could do was gawk at the vesproid, all covered in scratches and dents. She then faced the man and the two locked gazes. Irrationality and fear took over and compelled the man to flee his house, forgetting that-of the four faces that had poked through his roof-only three corpses litter the floor. Outside in the cold he felt something heavy land behind him. Spinning around he found the fourth soldier approaching him on all sixes. The defective vesproid quickly came up from behind as the soldier began to stand. Out in the open the soldier was better able to use its bulk against the slightly smaller defective unit. It delivered a savage punch to her right eye, smashing it. In a rage she grasped the soldier's two antennae and pulled them off, tossing the wriggling things aside. The soldier writhed in pain on the ground, unable to defend against the defective unit who now born down upon her. Pinning the soldier down, the she pried open the metallic plates encasing the front of her thorax. Two punches smashed whatever vital components were placed there and the soldier ceased all movement. The defective unit then tore off its head; whether out of spite or caution the man knew not. This time the man stood his ground as the vesproid approached him. In the dust she spelt out a word with her hand-foot. WHITEKNELL \" Is that your...name? \" the man asked, unsure of how she had acquired such intelligence. The vesproid's antennae twitched happily. \" Whiteknell it is then. \" He stuck out his hand and said, \" Dalton. Pleased to meet you. \" Whiteknell took his hand and shook it in a crude approximation of a handshake. The two remained out in the cold a little longer, entirely unsure of what to do next.

{"text": "The news anchor's face was slick with sweat and his hands fidgeted uncomfortably. It was a remarkable departure from his usual six o'clock bulletin composure. The bulge of his adam's apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed. He began talking, his voice surprisingly steady despite his tense demeanour. He opened with the disclaimer that this was not a live broadcast, and that everything in this message had been recorded at the start of the year. He spoke of the rising tensions between the United States and the Sino-Russian federation, of the growing web of treaties and alliances on every continent, of the failed attempts by disarmament groups to curtail the exponential growth horde of nuclear stockpiles across the world. He spoke of religious fanatacism pushed to the limit, of mistrust and xenophobia reaching a fever pitch, of the frenzied hunts for oil reservoirs that grew more and more frequent as reserves steadily shrank. He spoke of a world balanced on the edge of a pinhead. \"This message was recorded in case the worst should ever befall our nation,\" he said. \"If you are hearing this, then fear has finally overcome rationality, and a nuclear war is already in progress. I repeat, if this message is being broadcast, our country is facing imminent destruction by nuclear weaponry. Most likely, the first strike has already been launched. \"God willing, it was not our own who struck the first blow, and if it was, then may He have mercy on their souls.\" He swallowed one last time, and as suddenly as it began, the broadcast dropped off the air. Silence. The partygoers had each lapsed, one by one, into horrified, mute attention. Now that the broadcast was over, the abscence of noise in the apartment was quite profound. Then the screaming started. It was started by the young lady closest to the television set, then spread throughout the room like wildfire. There was a sound of a smashing glass dropped in disbelief, then a thud as the owner shortly followed it to the floor. One of the likely lads playing beer pong in the back flipped over the table and started smashing it apart with his forehead, bellowing incoherently. The screams and shrieks intensified in pitch as the host of the party ran towards the balcony and dove over the balustrade. His girlfriend charged after him, howling in grief, then threw herself down as well. Someone had pulled out a sack of heroin and had begun snorting themselves into unconsciousness, not bothering with a needle in order to expedite the process. When his body slumped to the floor, his buddy grabbed the supply and carried on his work. No less than three spontaneous orgies had broken out in different corners of the apartment. One participant began choking the woman he was mounting, another screamed as their partner's teeth closed around their genitalia. A man stumbled out of the kitchen, his arms drenched to the elbow in red, cackling hysterically. A severed leg flew out the door and clocked him on the back of the head. Smoke rose from a corner of the room as the inevitable fire started. It began slowly, creeping along steadily, blackening the mahogany floorboards. Some edged away from it as it advanced across the apartment, others still gave it no heed. Finally, it closed upon the leg of the first victim, still mid-coitus, who began shrieking like a wounded animal. Rather than flee, she turned round and plunged headfirst into it, rolling around as the flames consumed her greedily. She laughed, then screamed, and then her howling grew in volume until finally she was laughing again. In the midst of the manic, cacophonous bedlam, no one noticed the screen of the television set flicker back into life. It was the same news anchor as before, wearing a different suit but a possibly even more harangued expression. \"Dear viewers,\" he began again, \"this broadcast is actually live. There is no oncoming nuclear holocaust. We apologise for the previous transmission, which was in fact the result of a practical joke. I repeat, nuclear war is not imminent, any previous messages were played by a lone technician in our control room.

They knew that an argument was to follow, one of them would claim that his current life was more difficult, the other would claim that he would be able to support the two of them currently since he had a better salary. They decided to avoid doing all of that and flipped a coin. It landed on Thomson's open palm. \"Heads\" he announced. The twins stared at each other for a few seconds and then decided that one of them probably should've called it before flipping. \"Okay, I'm calling heads\" said Thomson. \"To be precise, heads is your call\" said Thompson.

His white labcoat swirled around him as he bounded towards the table, shifting the robotic arm above the table lightly so it was out of his way. He twitched slightly as the scalpel on the end of the arm sliced lightly across his shoulder. He felt a flash of pain. It didn't really bother him- the cut closed up within seconds in a blur of silver. \"Cyborg!\" his father said, \"An existence leagues above that of a normal human. A power beyond the reckoning of those secretive fat nobles conspiring in their dens!\" His father started laughing maniacally. He squinted up at the harsh white lights above the operating table. \"Why are you telling me this?\" he asked politely. \"Are you flattering me because you want me to do something for you?\" His father patted his cheek lightly, pushing away a lock of metallic silver hair.

If I wanted you to do something I'd just mess around with your spinal input unit while you're deactivated.\" \"Of course.\" he closed his eyes briefly. \"I see.\" \"You don't see.\" his father frowned lightly, adjusting his gleaming glasses, \"You don't understand, of course, how momentous this occasion is!\" \"Uh huh.\" he said dully. \"You see..... none of my cyborg experiments have managed to live to your age!\" his father cheered. \"Congratulations! Happy twenty-first birthday!\" he raised his hands, as if reaching for the lights, \"You're old enough to drink!\" he coughed, \"Well, you'd never get drunk anyway since I've calibrated your innards to automatically neutralize any carbon-based poisons, but still!\" His father moved back to the table, drawing the scalpel arm over his left eye. \"I didn't want to prematurely call you my cyborg before..... fear of failure I guess.

Don't you realize how important this is to me?!\" \"Congratulations, father.\" he said dutifully. \"I'm happy for you.\" \"As you should be.\" his father patted his head again. \"What a perfect child you are.\" he paused, rummaging around, \"Yes.....

The wow that's kinda racist once you think about it kind. Every recess we would team up and proceed to fight other gangs of Power Rangers. I knew my future was to become one of them. I would be a Power Ranger. I would save the world. Unfortunately, with how the job market currently is, being a Power Ranger is not economically feasible in this day and age. Plus, they are not real. I had always wanted to be a hero. Instead, I'm an overweight, overstressed, overworked debt collector. I'm the scum who calls you during family dinner, who nags you about the bills you have not paid. I am the one who stops your kids from getting to go to Disneyland. I am a loser. In the grand scheme of things my life doesn't matter. No one would notice if I died. Don't worry, fictional audience, I'm not going to kill myself, I am just being honest....my life simply has no significance. People just don't notice me. During my lunch break, I like to people watch. It is a way for me to have a life I vicariously live through others. You can learn a lot through people watching. For example, take that couple over there, who are entering into the bakery called Sugar Rush who has the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies ever. Sorry, lost focus. You can tell the couple are newlyweds. Look at how she holds his hand, their fingers interlocked like how he is the only person in the world that matters. See the way he stares at her? It's like she is the only one he can see. They are definitely just married. Plus they got out of the car that has \"just married\" written on the back windshield. In the last moments of my lunch break I see something interesting. I see a man, who is large and muscular, trying to be inconspicuous. He has been staring at a group of tourists for a while, pretending to read a book for some time. He doesn't change the pages, and his coffee has been empty for almost as long as he has been there, despite him pretending to take drinks. The tourists enter and exist the various shops following the path to towards the train platform. I'm assuming they're heading to the capital, since the man watching them said that into his phone. The tourist are none the wiser that this man has been watching and following them. I can tell this guy is trouble. He just gives off an aura that feels bad. Plus he has a gun. I just saw it briefly as he got up from his chair to follow them to the platform, and by the speed he is walking, I can tell something is about to happen. Plus he hung up his phone after saying, \"It's happening now.\" I follow. He is walking down the steps to the platform. The train is approaching now. They don't see him behind them. His gun is out. I had always wanted to be a hero. Now's the chance. I leap from steps and yell the first thing I can think of, \"it's morphing time!\" I frog splash on him in a way that would make Eddie Guerro proud. A few shots rang out, none of them hitting the tourists. People scream, the tourist make it to the train and the train takes off, heading to the capital. I think of what I will say to the news stations. \"Hero? I'm no hero. I was just at the right place at the right time. Anyone would have done it.\" I'm so enamored with my press conference and possible movie deal I don't notice the pain until it felt like my chest was on fire. I look down..... my white shirt crimson. The man pushes me off him, and begins to put pressure on my wound. \"You idiot,\" he says, \"why did you do that?\" \"You have no idea what you've just done. Stay with me!\" He orders. \"I had always wanted to be a hero...\" I weakly reply. The man responds, \"well, you're no hero today tubby, I'm FBI.\" I can tell he's telling the truth by his badge.

{"text": "Every year since the cessation of the emergence war the president would come on T.V. all across the world. The message was always the same: \"Once you turn 18 something of yours would be lost and in turn something would be gained. Do not be alarmed. Don't try to look for it, even if you miss it we all know it can never come back. No matter what you've been given do not let jealousy take you. The actions of the past are not to be repeated.\" at least that's how I summarized it to my little brother. Because it was my birthday my parents sat me down this year and told me how they got their powers. Mom had her whole family sit down with her and wait, when the clock chimed 12 nothing had changed. everything in her room was where she left it. she still had control of her faculties, her senses remained in tact. Her family took her in for testing as had become procedure. The doctors knew right away what was given, and moments later what was taken: the needle wouldn't pierce her skin for the blood test, she was invulnerable. Mom could resist any damage and continue to live. What was taken was just as clear. She had no pulse, her heart was gone. The doctors had said that even though this was one of the most extreme cases they had come into contact with it wasn't unheard of. Dads exchange was one for the news papers. He had it framed on the wall and I had already known the story but he just loves telling it. He had always loved to read as a child and had amassed an amazing collection. his room was wall to wall bookshelves, there was even one built into his door. When he woke up on his 18th birthday all of them were gone. Dad always tells us how he still loves reading, but now its minds. Everybody had to lose something, the president lost his face in exchange for extreme charisma. My older sisters car disappeared in exchange for super speed. The quarterback for my favorite football team only had one arm, but boy could that other one throw. I remember it all. I had sat waiting for the exact minute I was born 7:45pm, mom and dad were sitting with me in the kitchen waiting for the change. 7:44..... that was the last minute they saw me. That was the last time I was ever seen again, The last time I could interact with anything. To them I was there one moment and gone the next. There was a media frenzy, all across the country news crews came to interview my family. None of them wanted to comment but to say that they were very sad and confused as to what had happened. The news speculated for years \"Is there someone who has the power to obliterate people at will?\" \"Will this boys disappearance spark another war?\" \"The silent invisible boy: we still believe.\" None of them would ever guess what had happened. Let me take you forward a few years to my brothers 18th. he sat at the foot of his bed praying not to be taken like I had, nothing like that would happen to him. he was one of the thousands to lose his arms in exchange for telekinesis. still every day he prayed and hoped. I knew about everyone's prayers, their small hopes, everything they hated, every pang of hunger a lizard in the amazon felt, every gust of wind in the upper atmosphere of Saturn, everything. I had omniscience and in exchange for it I had been placed where all that was taken from everyone on earth had gone. Each recipient of their powers had their own room dedicated to their lost possessions neatly shelved away and organized. Sometimes when you feel sad I watch you out of all of them, you could think to yourself \"is there a god?\" or maybe \"what god would let this happen?\" I'm there with you desperately trying to tell you something: \"No.\" Not that I've found. I could never claim to be god and I cant change anything. I've taken to calling myself the historian.

{"text": "Kyra looked down at the metal box she held in her hands, and couldn't help but feel disappointed. She struggled to keep her face neutral as she disentangled herself from the brightly coloured pink wrapping paper that the box had come wrapped in. The card didn't even have money in. \"Thanks Uncle Rufus,\" she said, finally looking up. Kyra schooled her features into polite happiness and grinned at Uncle Rufus, who sat in the rocking chair by the window. Mother didn't like him much, because he refused to remove his muddy boots when he came into their house, and the tartan shirt he wore stunk of pipe-smoke and peat. He still had dirt beneath his fingernails and his red hair was tousled by the wind, beard straggly as a bird's nest. \"I really like the present.\" She placed her hand inside the box and nudged at the small, scaled creature that was coiled inside. It was smaller than a mouse, tiny combs like a cockerel's lining the back of its neck and down to the tiny tail, no wider than a needle at its base. At her touch, the dragon stirred itself and turned towards her hand. Its eyes were blue as sapphires, flashing against the deep royal green of the scales on its face. Two stubs on its back were all that promised the advent of wings. \"They grow,\" Uncle Rufus promised. \"That's a Scotch dragon. One of the last. I found the mother myself, after she'd birthed six of'em in a little bothy on my land. Almost burnt myself getting it away from her! Tha' was the smallest, thought it'd be perfect for little Kyra here.\" The last bit was addressed to Kyra's mother, who frowned. \"I'm not sure it's entirely appropriate for a child,\" she said. Her mouth had become a hard, flat line. Meanwhile, the dragon had nestled against the palm of Kyra's hand, closing its eyes and snuffling quietly. She had wanted a Pets Hospital, but as the dragon's warmth began to blaze against her palm, she realised she didn't mind too much. \"I like it, Mum,\" she said. \"It's alright, can I keep it?\" A moment of hesitation. \"Pleaseeee,\" she whined. \"She can come up to Jura with me if she wants,\" Uncle Rufus said. He was her dad's brother, not her mum's, and her dad was long gone. Kyra had only ever heard stories about the Scotch highlands, the dragons that walked the land: the size of cats, cars and castles. \"Over the summer holidays. She needs to get out of London, the air's no good for her round here, with all those cars and busses.\" \"You can keep the dragon,\" Mum relented. She didn't look happy about it. \"We'll talk about Scotland later.\" She picked up Uncle Rufus' mug, frown still etched tight on her face, and swept from the room. Kyra lifted the little green dragon from the box and looked at her Uncle. He stared intently as the dragon scurried up Kyra's arm like a mouse, the claws like small pinpricks on her skin. \"You got a name for her, lass?\" He asked. \"It always starts with a name.\" rSchoolgirlerror", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 125, "lang": "en"}

Dr. Vanderburg huddled under the reception desk, shaking and sobbing while excessively-maternal nurses smothered her. None of their comforting words of police questions affected her, she stared at the man who had just taken a bullet for her while he was scooped onto a stretcher and disappeared into a mob of doctors. Three days ago the heroin addict woke up in a hospital, and immediately started calling for the doctor, \" the pretty one with fingernail scratches on her forehead \" insisting that she needed to watch out for \" the blond man with the gun .\" His incoherent babbling made Dr. Vanderburg nervous. He had arrived unconscious and remained that way while she treated him, how could he know about her scars? Furthermore, how did he know about \" the blond man \"?

I will return the favor: Tomorrow, 9:15 am lobby.

He was obviously high and refused to leave, yelling loudly about how he has nothing and she has a family, and it should be him not her. The police were called and several doctors arrived to try to take him to the psych ward but he struggled and kicked, while Dr. Vanderburg stood uncomfortably by the desk. Until 3 minutes passed.

As he raised his gun, the doctor tried to take cover while heroin addict leapt, knocking the attacker to the floor, and receiving a bullet through his brain.

{"text": "Play Styles \"Naively enduring personality.\" Plax muttered from his nonchalant position by the wall. He watched as the player strode off towards the entrance to the amphitheater like structure, watched as he grimly noted the blood stains of past defeats. He looked more than a little ridiculous, encased in so much armor that he resembled a steel tortoise more than a warrior. He past out of sight, and Plax grimaced as a dry bellow signaled the duel to have begun. \"He thinks he can just absorb all the damage with that steel, but you can't make progress that way. Eventually its gon na be like poking your obstacles with a level seven stick, and then what? They aren't programmed to get bored of whacking your bunker of an armor load out. You end up wasting forty-five minutes scratching at their HP until they finally dent and chip your beautiful armor away and get to that gooey soft stuff you didn't bother upgrading either.\" As usual, Henry, the hanging corpse asset Plax had as a companion in this corner of the game world, was silent. Sometimes Plax wished he'd been paired with someone more interactive, who actually responded to his ideas and theories. But, then again, he did quite liked hearing himself muse, and wouldn't want another's babbling getting in the way of that. Careful what you wish for, and all that. In the distance the sound of scrapping metal and rumbling earth had suddenly stopped. There was another horrible shriek, and the music asset played signalling yet another death, and yet another trudge back here from the last check point. Plax tsked as another player ran by, different from the first. He was lithe, feline-esque in his movements, moving quickly over the rocky landscape. He wore hardened leather armor, including a cap that didn't look like it'd stop a bee sting, let alone a daemonic blade. He shifted what looked like a carving knife nervously in hand as he cautiously approached the amphitheater, not sparing Plax even a glance. \"Avoidant personality.\" Plax continued as Henry swung on a time released breeze. \"Can't roll away from your problems forever. You might be fast enough to dodge the first couple swings, might even land a hit or two. But the minute he gets a touch on you, its all over. I give this one eighty seconds, tops. I smell a restart in his future too; time to go back and pick a knight class. Even an archer is better than this.\" As predicted, the sounds of battle were over pathetically quick, with yet another shriek and another musical dismissal. Plax looked up at the generated sun, calculating that it had moved seventy-six seconds further towards its dynamic night cycle. He smiled at Henry. \"Told you.\" Seconds after the leather clad player was vanquished, a new player mounted the horizon. He was clad in animal skins-wolf, bear, lion, whatever animals the character class was supposed to have killed in their nonexistent backstory-no protection against a blade in any case. But what really drew ones attention was the massive axe the man carried. It was easily as tall as him, though he hefted it casually on his shoulder; double-headed, with the skulls of defeated enemies emblazoned on the blades. Along its breadth fire and ice magic twisted around one another in an unholy union of AOE damage. Plax couldn't help but smile. He glanced over at Henry concedingly. \"Belligerent personality. Don't know if he's any smarter than the other two, but I like his moxie.

{"text": "I had stopped counting how long I've been away. What I do know is that everyday while I was gone, I wanted to see you. It was impossible to ignore the gaping whole on my chest that I tried to fill with thoughts and moments that didn't involve you. Nothing worked, unsurprisingly. You were the only thing that could keep the black hole in the center of me from swallowing my existence. You wrote three hundred sixty-five letters. I know there were more but I stopped reading when I finally got to the point I realized I wasn't doing us a favor. Not once did I return a written thought until one day they just stopped coming. But that doesn't mean I stopped thinking of you. I probably still will as long as we're under the same stars. But today I just needed to see you. Today I just needed to know I did the right thing. Or maybe I needed to know you were as miserable as I was without you. Or maybe I needed to relive that day when the stars aligned for us. I stepped forward, a step closer to the abode that sheltered you and what we once had. The door opens and I see your brother and his wife coming out. My stomach drops and I lose all courage I managed to muster up to see you. Your brother and his wife adored me. Used to. I don't imagine he could forgive me after I left you with nothing but a note to hold onto. Minutes pass and you follow them out. I feel my breath get knocked out of me as I see your smile again. It was the same one you wore when you looked at me. She comes after you moments after, kind eyes, warm smile, golden hair. She takes your hand and I struggle to keep my balance. The ring shines in the sunlight. She calls out a name and out comes racing a small boy who looked like a carbon copy picture of you. You take him into your arms. He turns to me with your ocean eyes. You turn to see what he was looking at. For a second, when our eyes met I could see what I had been missing out on. Those eyes of yours could swallow stars, galaxies, and universes. What hope did I ever have?", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 133, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "She and I giggled as we folded the aluminum into little bowls for our little heads. We giggled at the idea that foil hats would block mind control rays from the TV, something a friend had told us. We giggled at the fact that we knew we'd get in trouble, we had used the last of the foil and her mom would be furious when she found out. We giggled because giggling makes things fun. \"I don't think it's working\" I said aloud after having mine on for a few moments. \"I still think my mind is being controlled.\" She snickered at me \"Okay then, dance monkey!.\" I stood up and danced a ridiculous jig in a mocking fashion, then as I went to be seated I stumbled and fell. I tried to catch myself on the coffee table but I ended up knocking my head against it instead. \"Are you okay?!\" she belted out, and I recall that I didn't know. A small cherry colored patch of red skin flanked a narrow slice in my forearm and blood dribbled out slowly. I could feel the cold wetness of the blood, but there was nothing else. No pain, no worry, no thought at all. \"You're bleeding\" she said as she approached me, \"let's go to the kitchen and clean you up, and get some ice on your head..\" The cleaning and bandaging of my arm was both extremely loud and extremely quiet. I heard the sounds as I had never heard them before. The water running, the bandage package opening, the trash can lid slamming shut. It was as if someone had turned the volume up on my life, but something was missing. I knew I had been hurt though I had no feeling. I felt no pain, and I didn't care. Not until she took off my cap to push a bag of frozen peas against my temple did the explosion of pain and chatter come back. \"OuchAmIOkay? DoIHaveAConcussion? AmITired?.\" Hundreds of thoughts talked over each other so that I couldn't properly piece them apart. That was the first time it happened. \"Today's the day\" it read on the calendar near the fridge. I walked past a can filled with empty foil containers and bottles of warehouse brand vodka. My stride was brisk as I enter my room and open my closet. The clothes had been picked long ago, it was simply a matter of retrieving them and laying them out. After they had been neatly placed on my bed I shed the current ones and made for the bathroom, turning the shower knob to hot. With the door closed the steam billowed and fogged up the mirror. Meticulous cleaning seemed both strange, and necessary. The water sounded a bit like rain on a window as it cascaded off my head. Minutes later a nice big clean towel enveloped me in warmth as I dried off. I set about preparing for the important evening as I had dozens before tonight, aside from the occasional beads of water dripping from above. Back in my bedroom I donned the apparel I had prepared, checking the mirror after each article to ensure its placement was correct. I laid down and clutched a single piece of paper. \"No second thought without first.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 134, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "The pen rolled and rumbled around the paper, bulldozing through the clauses, determined to finalize the moment as planned. It was the second the signature on the piece of paper, the first had nervously been planted by the gentle, wet hand of the older gentleman sitting uncomfortably in front of him. \"And you said it will only take a few days?\" the man enquired, hands rolling his battered hat in his hands, creased eyes cloudy as if he was trying to fight back the progress he had just signed way, \"Everything will be taken care of?\" The second man, suited, lounging behind the large mahogany desk covered in models and concepts and fat folders filled with sums and figures, paused for a moment and looked over the top of his glasses. \"Oh yes, indeed they will,\" another nonchalant signature went down forming a big sprawling signature, \"you'll have nothing to worry about in the end, we'll be taking care of everything.\" The hat rotated several more times while the final, awaited signature was signed off with a loud forceful fullstop. Silence now hung in the air like the pen which lingered over the contract. Both seemed to be considering the full repercussions of the action before the pen was carefully returned to the gilded holder which sat to one side. \"Done\" the suited man announced cheerfully, a smile constructed on his face \"Now if you go and see Katherine sort out the last remaining bits and bobs, not least the account you'll want the money transferred to. One needs to know these details when trying to provide for ones family after all.\" The balding grey head nodded in agreement, eyes now downcast onto the floor. \"I must, mustn't I. I thought I had saved enough you know. For my wife and I, my retirement, my children and my grandchildren.\" One hand detached itself from the hat and he wiped the forming tears away, \"But at you least you've been good. Offering me all those loans, even when interest rates and it became harder to afford the repayments. I needed those to feed my family, to house them, to keep them warm.\" The smile seemed to expand even more as the suited man replied \"And that's why we're letting you live in the house. We're not heartless you know. You get all the money and get to keep living in the house until the term of the contract expires.\" The hand slowly reattached itself to the battered hat, then hat was slowly lifted up and planted gingerly on top his head, \"I'm sure we can find another smaller place, I've heard of worse than 6 people in a two bedroom house.\" Slowly, fighting and using his hands as the roots to raise him up he stood and shuffled his way to the door. \"But I might need some help then. And I think once I'm gone my children might definitely need help. It's hard to get a hand up in life without some help.\" The suited man leaned further pack into his seat and built his smile even bigger. The contract clad in a thick rubber band was deposited with the rest in a filer draw. \"Oh we can help. We're always quite ready to help. You, your children, grandchilden, we hope we can help them all. I hope to say we can help them forever. As long as they can agree to our terms that is.\" The old man nodded once, exited remorsefully out the door and quietly pulled it behind him. The pen was from its resting position and put it use again, scoring through the final name on a list of other struck through names. It would take few years longer than he had hoped, as it had taken to get to this point. The pen moved on the golf course plan as it fabricated his dream design. He would get what he wanted, and there might be some waiting involved, but his desires would not be kept from him. \"Just remember\" he said to nobody in particular as he renovated and removed \"you can always trust your bank.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 136, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Journal.txt Timestamp: Monday 7th December 2015 at 23:30 It is over. It is finally over. The Telecommunications final is done, and, really, didn't seem all that bad after all. Somehow, it all seemed to come to me, even the formulas that I was so worried about last night. Maybe..... maybe I actually did learn more than I thought I had. It's funny - when I usually feel like this after a test I'm nervous it could either go really well or really poorly. This time though? Somehow, I just feel like I completely nailed it - that there's no way I didn't get an A at last. Time will tell of course, but I've never felt this confident about this class. Oddly, I wasn't even that tired today, even though I got myself up and out of bed at a reasonable time for once. Wonder if I can do it tomorrow even though I don't have to go to the gym..... And yet, despite that awesome Monday night football game that I'm still hyped about I think I won't have much of a problem going to sleep tonight. Maybe I won't lie awake for an hour before falling asleep for once this fall..... Would be nice. Oh my God. My phone just went off - notification tone (text). I can't believe it. She actually likes me!? When we had lost touch last month I just thought that was that. After all, every last piece of dating advice out there seems to say that it's a fade if you don't hear from her for 3 days. I totally knew she was just busy with things. Now how not to screw this thing up like last time? Knowing my luck I'll be too forward this time since over the summer I wasn't forward enough..... Before I turn off for the night, I might as well go ahead and order those textbooks. 410 for two classes' worth of books? Damn. Let's just get that out of the way and be done with it. Go into the university system to get the titles..... What? They opened another section of 5143?! One that lets me sing with the choir next spring after all?! Thank you, God! It may not make sense logically, but it really feels as if a miracle just happened. Journal, I was absolutely dreading facing the spring semester without having rehearsal on Tuesday nights to look forward to. They're an intense group, but being able to sing with someone is just absolutely critical for keeping myself able to cope with all the nonsense that gets thrown my way. Ah! I can't wait to tell them tomorrow night! It will be tough balancing work, class, and choir again, but I'll do it.

{"text": "Ranma laughed, trying to encourage all those in the hall to join. \"My father jests, even in the face of death! Truly a light-hearted man to the end. Now, please, father. Place the crown on either Kalin's head or mine, and be done with the ceremony. We are your loyal sons, here to serve and protect the realm.\" The king hacked loudly, coughing blood all over his robe. \"Foolish boy, the only jest here is that you truly think yourself fit for the throne. I have named this servant boy king. Do you not see the crown upon his head?\" He turned to the newly crowned servant. \"What is your name?\" The frail slave, dark skin barely covered by tattered rags, was trembling with fear. \"Do not be afraid, son. All these years you have served me, and I never thought to ask. Tell the world the name of their next king.\" Kalin interrupted, his words a blade, slicing their conversation in twain. \"Son? Did you just call that worthless scum son? A name which you have not even used to refer to your actual sons? You'd tarnish our name with such ease?\" \"EASE?\" the king bellowed, finding voice despite his sickness. \"You think it easy for me to do this? You truly are a fool, as is your brother. I'm not the one that ordered the execution of a child for being a besting me in a fight, Kalin. I'm not the one that tortured animals for pleasure in my quarters, Ranma. You're both children, and you're cruel already with what little power you have. Let us make this very clear, sons: I am not the one that tarnished your namesakes- you did that yourselves. Do not ever think to lay blame on me.\" The sons fell silent, their heads hanging in shame, fists clenched with rage. The king resumed his conversation with the servant. \"Tell me your name, boy. You've served here many years now.\" \"13 years, sir. I am 17 now. My name is Dhuq'a,\" the boy answered as instructed. \"Dhuq'a is a fine name. Tell me something, Dhuq'a- do you want to be king?\" \"Well, Your Grace, I..... I don't know that I'm fit to be a king. I merely serve you food and clean, Your Grace. I know nothing of politics or war.\" \"Good, politicians make me sick. There are advisors and councils for that, you know. They can guide you, and there are elders to help you learn for yourself.\" Ranma burst, no longer able to contain himself. \"Father, please,\" he tried to choke out through tears, \"I promise I'll be a good king. A strong king, don't give the throne to some..... some filthy slave, he's not worthy of something so grand. You can't just abandon your blood, your sons.\" \"See, you bloody idiot, this is the problem. Nobody as blind as yourself, even at 20, should be allowed a throne. You don't care about anything other than being king. It's a toy to you, something precious and you want it. You think it's yours, and you deserve it, just as I did when I was a boy. I tried to raise you two proper, to be someone better than I was at your age, but clearly I failed. Thankfully, I am no longer the man I was. I see beyond bloodlines and smashing villages for power.\" \"Please, father, I'll do anything. I'm begging you,\" Kalin pleaded, his knees on the cold, marble flooring. \"Anything? Then fall on your sword. You can have the throne when you're dead.\" The crowd fell silent after a series of sharp gasps echoed through the sons' ears. Their groveling halted, leaving them staring at the swirled marble dotted with tears, completely taken aback by their father's words. \"To see you begging, crying for the throne. I'd hoped at least one of you could remain strong and accept my decision with honor, like a true man of dignity. But instead you grovel and snivel, teary-eyed and weak-kneed. You are not men; you are children. I can not entrust this kingdom to one of you.\" He turned to Dhuq'a and smiled. \"Dhuq'a, I hereby name you king of this great realm; Protector of Mundakaa and its cities. You have known pain, growing up a slave. You have known hardship, working every day without complaint, taking beatings at the whim of a cruel master. You know the plight of those in the lower class, and you are a kind, wise soul beyond your years. You have served me well, always, and I can see in your eyes that you will be neither a cruel nor weak king. This is a dying man's last request, Dhuq'a. Be a king for the people, not for yourself.\" \"I will try, Your Grace.\" thanks for reading! you can find more at rresonatingfury", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 139, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "AN: I was listening to the First Hunter OST when I came up with this:)..... \"Sir Fianna, Knight of the Holy Kingdom. The blood-drenched traitor. The forsaken dragon.\" Red eyes tilted up slowly, scanning his battered armour and the dried blood crusting on his gloves. His sword hung loose in one hand, trailing red across the ground. \"To what do I owe the pleasure of your presence within my lair?\" Red eyes narrowed with glee. His fists tightened briefly, creaking against steel. He relaxed, breathing out audibly. \"Lady of the Spiders, I have come to seek a boon.\" He thrust his sword into the ground before him and bowed his head, pressing his hands to the floor as he knelt. There was a skittering of noise. A pale limb emerged from the darkness of the aged throne, a thin spider's legs bristling with fine, poisoned hairs, then another. He did not look up. A slim, warm hand caressed his jaw and he looked up into the beautiful, innocent form of a young woman leaning out of the shadows towards him. Her long white hair fell across her shoulders like rivers, hiding her garments. \"You're amusing, Sir Knight.\" she smiled, \"We have danced this dance before many times, you and I- you interfere with my plans, I try to kill you, you fail to kill me Her fingers scraped across his bared throat with inhuman strength, lifting him off the ground. He gritted his teeth, refusing to make a sound. The grip was released. He fell to the floor, lungs spasming as he tried to draw in breath. A spider's leg, as long as his body tapped the floor impatiently, gouging into the stone floor. \"But you seem to truly need my help..... well. Will you tell me your tale?\" He closed his eyes and bowed his head as he collected himself. \"I have been exiled from the Kingdom. I have been found guilty of high treason, of consorting with the Queen. I am not guilty.\" he felt himself calm and focus as he thought of his words, \"I was betrayed by my King, by my elder lords! My dear comrades whom I thought I could trust spoke foul rumours against me. My lord King whom I valued above all others ordered my death and disgrace through an execution instead of honorable battle!\" She tilted her head, \"So that is what you seek, revenge. A cold comfort.\" she smiled, \"You want to poison their waters and burn their crops. You want to lay a curse on their households. I would be pleased to make you mine in exchanhe, to rescue you and elevate you above this false ignominy-!\" Steel rang. He rose, standing to his full height. His sword was buried in the creature's gut. It had lowered its guard, come within striking range of his nearby blade. The enchanted steel sunk through her stony flesh like butter. \"You, you- you fool!\" Black blood showered out of the wind as she leapt up to the ceiling. He saw her body, the hideous body of a giant wolf spider crowding the latticed ceiling. The shadows bubbled and skittered as man-sized spiders crept out in waves, covering the aged masonry. \"You proud foul!\" He flicked the blood off his blade. \"I ask you to give me an honourable death. I ask you to face me as you would a hero who comes with no aid, no army, no magic to save him from certain destruction.\" He brandished the sword, lunging through a spider and slicing the legs off another. Black ichor splattered across his face, highlighting his wild grin. \"I ask you for my salvation! To prove my loyalty to the Kingdom by falling to my maddened blade!\" He charged forward, dodging aside from a corrosive curse, stabbing into another bloated, malformed belly. His armor, once shining, once polished was covered in a black ichor, steeped in curses that ate into his flesh. \"Give me back my honour!\" He ignored the fangs and claws that stabbed against him. He ignored the weight collapsing in his pauldrons, crushing his left arm. He dragged himself onwards as the Spider Queen fled from his wrath back towards the darkness. \"Give me back my pride!\" He chased after her inexorably, stumbling through halls of ancient, weathered tapestry. He sliced through her brood, killing everything that came in his path. He met her on the bridge of the abandoned castle. She stood between him and the lands beyond the moat, her full hideous form revealed in the pale moonlight of the full moon. He raised his broken blade, crushing his marred hands up to lift it towards the empty night. His breath escaped him in harsh, shallow pants. His limbs felt numbed and leadened as curses cut into his very soul, detaching his senses. He staggered across the bridge, holding his blade steadily. There was movement behind him, the dozens, hundreds, thousands of spiders that were left of the Spider Queen's uncountable brood. He walked on, dragging himself towards her beautiful, inhuman form. An all too human terror was present in her colourless eyes. One strike. It was all he could manage. His fingers trembled. His chest hurt with every breath. His vision blurred and all he could see in the darkness was the pale smudge of her form. Moonlight ran along his blade as he raised it and lunged with the last of his strength. He fell to his knees. The Spider Queen loomed above him, a blade stuck through her guts. She pulled it out, flicking it to the side. It fell, sinking into the darkness of the abyssal moat. He let out a bitter laugh. He couldn't defeat her after all. He could not return in triumph to his Kingdom, restored in name before his King. He knew he would not be able to prove his loyalty to the Kingdom, his desire to sacrifice all for its glory, his honour above all reproach. She knelt before him, catching him as he fell. Soft arms wrapped around him and he gazed into the face of an angel. \"Sir Knight...\" She trembled. Her breath was cold and light against his face. \" ..... you have certainly won back your honour.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 140, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Hanna looked at the tall trees out the car window. The tall pines ranked like soldiers, the black pooling shadows deeper the pines like great subaqueous stilts in the blackness or giant arrows stuck straight in the ground She thought she could see vague stirrings of Puppydog slinking throughout the forest. The world felt crystal behind the car window, like a movie, Hannah could feel the patterns interlocking in their seismic connects, the trees writhing and, limbs waving under wind like shellacked preachers. The passed the crest of a hill passing a sign that said 30 miles, and descended the valley. She could see the close pines moving by swiftly and the farther trees passing slow like the car was lassoed to a rope that was slowly reeling her round. She closed her eyes, bored at the scenery and leaned back against the headrest, she heard something talking softly nothings and Hannah listened, the radio was on talking about crucifixtion. She frowned and when she reached for the volume nob she noticed it was Chris probably talking crap again. The radio was off. 'Yeah the house was fine top too bottom' And then it hit her. Eviction, the fucking eviction of course. She was was evicted. She nodded with him vacantly yet her mind flew back. She had been hearing noises in the house for the last few months. Mousetraps had been set and one had been caught and killed. She had fed to Jaspers, Jaspers had ignored the prize and it began to stink up her apartment. But the noises increased, followed by a knocking sound. The plumbers had left after tramping all over the flat and leaving great chalk boot stains on her carpet. She took some of it between her fingers, she knew it was the same consistency of the chalk that was of the same type to the soil in Champagne in France. She remembered when she spent time working on the trenches. Father when he was alive had arranged it through the Imperial War Museum where he had a few friends. There was construction work going on nearby that they were working on. The plumbers laughed and said she was a brave woman for taking some soil left on plumbers boot after she was right. Curious. 'Some mad eccentric imported the stuff for his garden' joked one plumber, as the other took apart her tap. They also checked the windflow in the house, and while one explained how drafts can slam doors shut. She didnt think they would be so knowledgeable but they were surprisingly witty and intelligent. They even petted Jaspers who pawed at the hand that fed him. Puppydog when he was still around would have lingered in her peripheral vision whispering sweet nothings and then would have advised her to store car battery acid in a plastic watercooler cup to cast in their eyes in case they raped her. She brought over Chris and they looked over the house he identified the vent near the ceiling as the culprit, sound was being echoed from the old pipes and muttering from a old laundry chute that propped the building like a spine. Knocking and a low muttering that sometimes drifted in, always pleasant things about cooking spaghetti and football games in England. Sometimes she heard low groans, almost sexual groans but she wasn't sure. Chris had been worried about her 'Hannah 'Yeah' 'You okay there, yeah?' 'Mm' 'Okay make sure your taking your meds you know' 'Yeah thanks Chris' 'Just making sure Han.' He smiled eyebrows raised nodding a little in that little display of Chris-ness. She smiled a grimace, you fuck, big bro Chris looking after Bannana Hannah, I heard the jokes, big girl did you take your lollipop, Hannah is craazeey, she knew he made sure but it was maddening being around him. She remembered in college they were predrinking, she was doing most of it. White russians, they were drinking White Russians. She could remember the sweet taste of vodka. Hannah cast her mind back. A birthday party, it was hers she she thought. There had been quite a few since. Hannah was joking around having a quiet staring contest with Tara and Chris became agitated mentioned the'm' word. She was always careful and she felt so flustered and embarrassed like a stake twisting in the gut she wished she could close her eyes and not exist. Puppydog was bad that month, he came back with a snarl. Together they found a chink in the corner of the carpet where it was ripped up and the concrete was underneath and he urged her to sharpen the end of her toothbrush. She was a vampire and horrible old vampire. She ignored Chris for a while and he apologized in the end. 'Chris?' Yeah he looked over to her, him 25 and already going a bald the hair pointing forward like the prow of ship but the beard giving his weak jaw an aura of sturdiness. 'Wheres Tara these days?' 'Tar- oh Tara? Jeez thats a throwback' he laughed and stroked his thinning hair. He paused thinking looking glum. 'Tara..... - I think Tara went volunteering in uh Ghana, great place apparently, you'd think it would be all disease and warlords,\" he snorted, and scratched his beard with one hand, \"She never mentioned it when we were last chatting\" Hannah said \"She always said she wanted to go travelling after nursing\" Chris said quietly. It was quiet for a moment \"Tara,\" he said sadly,\" a great girl\" They remained in silence. They were nearly there. She didn't want to be here, Chris urged her to come to the national park. It was after the eviction, which to be honest couldn't have come at a better time, her lease was up and the place was crap, she was on the right meds, she was looking for a better place, thank god for her trustfund, a place found her a place near the park back home and he was only down the road from his work. He knew she loved that park, it was where she found Jasper as a little kitten and took him back. She was off her meds on that day but Jasper eased it somehow. Puppydog told her to skin it alive with a stanley blade. manywaystoskinacat he said, and it was rare when he spoke. She did do some bizarre things though, she remembered buying 200 tins of dog food and mailing it to dog pounds to appease Puppydog, she remembered gluing every penny in the house to the ceiling to connect to the stars. She remembered when she went to the park to talk to Puppydog. Puppydog would take over a duck and he loved croissants. He in turn made her eat her own hair and when she found Jasper she stopped it and petted that little ball of fur. They continued down the valley around a bend. Chris stopped the car, and put the carkeys in his pocket. He turned to her and said, 'Just a quick smoke break' He then smiled. He left the car and it plipped the doors locking. Hannah stayed in the seat, she was tired from the long trip. She watched Chris and his small shoulders hunched as hit lit his cigarette, his beard tipped with grey and how they shared everything even when her parents were gone and she felt a tenderness for him, he was her brother and she was this difficult bitch that hampered his life. Hannah looked at it, the far away trees small the size of pin's and their leaves soft like a flame from a Bic lighter, the closer ones serrated, and large like matches and the nearest ones looming giants like a parent over a bed, bending with your vertigo. Hannah could see Chris answer and while the smoke drifted over his shoulder like a veil and he talked animatedly. She could hear'Tara' mentioned coming through the closed window tinny and he looked so happy smiling for the first time in months and she was sure, her heart leaping at her name a little. She loved her brother and wanted him to be happy. She imagined Chris and Tara together and she felt a rare joy at it. She would make a great aunty. They pulled out and went on the road, she waited a few moments. 'Was that Tara' she asked casually 'No' he said easily, 'But I heard you said her name, on the phone, where you talking about her?' He nibbled his lip and then looked at her,'Ok, Yeah it was Tara' 'Oh' He smiled lips pursed. 'Then 'I was trying to keep it a surprise Hannah! Ok?' he said, his eyebrows raised. The trip proceeded smoothly they were nearly there, the trees grew closer, but she and Chris did not. She was nearly in tears, and Puppydog began poking his face at her between the trees making faces full of teeth at her, a face of evil. He was bounding beside the car full of teeth and lies telling her to pull the handbrake of the car. Chris pulled into the national park and the cabin there and Tara standing their her hand shading her eyes. Chris smiled and said, 'Please Hannah will you wait here a moment.' 'No problem Chris' she smiled,'go get her'. 'Yeah' he looked at her and gave a crooked grin. She waited. Chris exited the car, careful to lock it, and walked to Tara, his feet crunching the gravel. 'How did you manage' she asked and she hugged him. He shuddered, 'I think it was a mistake for me to breach training. No first names 'Chris, her trustfund. Her parents wished the best for her and god knows I was no shakes as an actor and I dont want to wipe arses for the rest of my life.\" Chris looked at her. 'Those bastards, all these years and fucking Lord whathisname I haven't even met them. This is wrong Tara' 'We are making her happy, this place will properly care for her and don't ever mention his name babe, even in anger or joking, this isn't exactly legal'. Chris disengaged from her hug and looked away. 'The constant relapses from when she thinks in college again? How are they still alive? She's almost fifty' 'I know its hard' Tara soothed,\"but 'In a few weeks she is going to ask if we had children yet and that horrendous fucking doll, after the marriage of course? And then back to- to college and we are drinking fucking milk its not even real\" Chris broke, and he began to weep falling to his knees, and Tara placed her hand on his head. 'Oh Chris, I know, I know, I know, but Chris' she gulped and stooped down to him stroking his thinning hair,'we could retire of her' Hannah was smiling raptly at Chris and Tara embracing, it was like the movies, the kiss the hot mouths, the hand touching the neck. Puppy dog had retreated to the sorrows squealing and gnashing his teeth then Chris began to cry. But it was fine, Chris was on his knees and his just asked Tara to marry him.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 141, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "My entire life I've been told the legend of'the Tower'. The legend never specifically states where the Tower is located, merely that it is at the very edge of the world. It speaks of a tower with stone as smooth as silk, a tower with no windows or doors, but instead a hole in the roof, hidden far above protected by the clouds themselves. It tells of how over the centuries adventurers have discovered the towers location and attempted to scale it, to no avail. Hundreds have tried, hundreds have fallen to their demise, never to be seen from again. I shall not join them in their fate. I shall succeed where they failed. I will find out what the tower so jealously guards. It was on my 18th birthday that I set out on my adventure. My parents were sad to see me go because they truly didn't believe that the Tower existed, they believed it just a legend. They believed I'd die in my search for it. I planned to prove them and everyone else wrong. My adventure was a hard one, for years I searched the wastes with no luck, no money, barely any food a majority of the time and no companions. I didn't stay in one place for long as I mapped out the world, looking for its edge. It was 12 years after I left home that I discovered the slightest hint that the Tower even existed, I must admit that in that time I had begun to lose faith. With this clue my resolve was invigorated and I searched even harder. I searched and searched for another 8 years, but I never found another clue about the location of the Tower. I gave up my search after 22 years of tirelessly scouring the globe for its edge. I found a small village and I bought a farm, I made a life for myself. I found someone to love, who loved me back and we had children. I told my children the legend of the Tower, I gave them everything I'd discovered about it or rather didn't discover, all in the hopes that they would finish what I started. As I lay there on my deathbed, my son came up to me and told me that he would find the Tower. With my last breath, I told him something I'd never told him before. \"The tower isn't real son, it's a pipe dream, a fantasy. Don't pursue it. Live your life happily. I love you.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 143, "lang": "en"}

I changed politics to make war the exception rather than the rule. Life expectancy rose. When we met, someone died around once every ten seconds. And now, with all the work I've done, it's 1.8 deaths per second. My strategy was backwards. Now I never see him, and I'm not sure he'd want to after what I did.

{"text": "\"Will you be happy when I go to sleep, daddy,\" she asked. \"Oh sweetheart,\" he said to her, \"well, I'm going to miss you a lot, and I'm always going to love you.\" \"You have to be happy still, okay daddy?\" she insisted. \"Okay baby,\" he whispered. \"You have to eat cookies for breakfast and you have to have a tree-house and you have to be friends with an alligator, okay daddy?\" \"Friends with an alligator?\" he chuckled, crying. \"Yes,\" she insisted, \"that's what I would have done, if I didn't have to go to sleep all the time.\" How much later he couldn't tell, but the machines were blaring. He'd drifted off in the chair. The nurses and doctors rushed in. And then it was done. \"No, it's just, I thought you meant something else when you said you had a surprise,\" Marian said, \"like maybe you were ready to try to- never mind. Jake, you can't be serious about this. Is this even legal? What if it escapes?\" \"It was the last thing she asked me to do,\" he said. \"She was four years old.\" \"It was the last thing she asked,\" he repeated. \"Fine,\" Marian relented, \"let me see.\" The alligator was a few weeks old, small enough to live in a small enclosure under a heat lamp. It was filled with rocks and artificial, tropical ferns with long, impossibly green leaves covered in dew. She was six, maybe seven inches long, striped brown and black. Her pupils were thin black lines in a mustard yellow eye; her teeth were like tiny icicles dotted around her cotton candy tongue. In not much time, he knew, she would be many feet longer. She would need most of the backyard. He'd stop treating the pool with chemicals, throw in fish and crustaceans every day. For the time being, he'd feed her by hand, so she trusted him, felt safe with him. \"You know they can't feel love, right?\" Marian said, \"This isn't like a dog, their brains aren't evolved to have emotions like that. All they know is food, reproduction, fight or flight. But I can, Jake. I can still feel things, I still remember how I used to feel with you, or what real life was like. This is fucking crazy, Jake. I loved her too, you know. And I'm not going insane like this. I lost her and now I'm losing you too, I guess?\" He ignored her. He took a frozen cricket and lowered in into the enclosure, the insect supine on his open palm. She lunged, in an instant, from the corner of the glass tank, snatching the insect in her long mouth, then turning away. She had taken a piece of his skin as well. His blood was slowly trickling out of the small cut. It was okay. She didn't mean it. She'd never hurt him on purpose.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 145, "lang": "en"}

Most of the'joke' games I'd acquired from friends over the years (Bad Rats included, thankfully) disappeared. OK, shit, this is weird. I decided that it was probably a system error or something, and loaded up the game I was playing through by recommendation of a friend: Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re; Birth1. It was pretty fun, I had to admit. Cute characters, fourth wall breaking, it was the console industry war but fun..... Heh. Glad I followed his advice. I loaded the game up, continuing from where I left off. I approached a wild monster, and prepared for battle, transforming all the characters I had into HDD forms to combat the cluster of beasts. After a well-fought battle, with a finishing move by Iris Heart, I received the victory animation, and- The game closed. Steam now displayed a large screen with one sentence on it: You dirty fucking pervert. I groaned. Was Steam an AI now?! Sitting back up, I decided to load another game. How could Steam disagree with Team Fortress 2? I clicked play. And waited. And waited. I clicked again. Nothing. What the fuck is going on? Then, much to my pent-up frustration, more words appeared. No. Literally no. I growled, and went to the address bar at the top of the window. Why? It's a fucking shit game for plebs. No, it's actually fun. Then you're mentally challenged.

{"text": "With 30,000 employees all over the globe and 42 billion in revenue to lead, busy doesn't even begin to describe my day. I'm good, though. Mama taught me young how to trust, how to delegate, and how to get things done. Hell, even my delegating is delegated these days. Hiring decisions below the Vice-President level don't even come across my desk. But more goes on at this company than I'll ever know about. I like to walk through the cube mazes on the lower floors sometimes, check in with the various administrative assistants, hear what's going on. More often than not this grapevine gives me more insight into what's going on in the company than 300 different \"executive dashboards.\" It's a good habit. And this habit led me to overhearing a phone conversation. I was checking in on Samantha Beeman in HR, making some joke that bordered on inappropriate but definitely wasn't, and I heard a voice in the cubicle next to hers. \"Yes, may I please speak with James Finnegan?\" I froze. I realized that I froze, and tried not to look like I was freezing, which really resulted in an awkward stumbling of words and a fake-confident grin. Did I mention 30,000 employees? Million and billion dollar acquisitions? Why did one name cause my heart to jump into my throat? \"We received your resume for the Sales Associate position. Can you come in for an interview?\" I was struggling to still pay attention to Samantha while focusing intently on this conversation. \"Next Tuesday at 3:00? Perfect. We'll see you there. You'll be meeting with Jane Goodrich, our Senior Retail Manager, and Rob Freeman from Human Resources.\" I quickly made a mental note and reinforced my eye contact with Samantha, just in time to laugh at the end of her anecdote. I excused myself CEO stuff... and made my way down to the 8th floor, where Jane Goodrich had a modest office with an assistant outside. I didn't know Jane personally, but I knew Bobby, her assistant. He was actually my younger brother's friend. \"Hi, Jim!\" the young man smiled at me. \"Hey, Bobby. How the job treating you?\" \"Oh, man, I love this place!\" I'd worked hard to build a vibrant culture in this company, and the millenials were soaking it up. \"Bobby, quick question for you. Did I overhear that Jane's going to be interviewing someone next Tuesday at 3:00 PM?\" Bobby checked Jane's calendar. \"Yup. James Finnegan. I sorted the resumes for her; this guy seemed okay. Not much on his resume that was impressive, but not many people are applying these days.\" \"Bobby, can you forward me a copy of that resume?\" \"Sure thing, Jim. Why?\" \"Oh, you know me..... just keeping my finger on the pulse.\" Back in my office, I had 15 minutes before I had to head to the airport for a weekend trip. I pulled up the resume for James Finnegan. Indianapolis address. Most recently worked for the better part of a decade at a low-end mattress retailer. That seemed right. Everything matched up with what the private investigator had found for me 5 years ago. Was it a coincidence? I decided it wasn't. My flight was short but I barely noticed it; I was wrapped up in thought. Even when my rental car was delivered, I almost ran over the attendant pulling out. It wasn't until I got to Mama's house that I was able to focus again. \"Mama!\" I shouted, when she greeted me at her door. \"Jim! You're looking taller and more handsome than usual!\" We laughed as I gave her a kiss on the forehead and we marched right back out to the car. She talked for a while as I drove, though she politely let me answer a call from our Development VP, who wanted to fill me in on the upcoming FDA approval audit for our new baby-food line. Did I mention 42 billion in revenue last year? We're diversified. Anyway, she talked and I drove. I found myself driving up to North Shore looking for a fancy restaurant with a view. She didn't seem to notice, and I was okay with that. The restaurant was crowded, but the maitre d' recognized my name and got us a good seat. As we sipped a glass of wine, I decided to ask her what had been on my mind. \"Mama, 30 years ago...\" I paused. \"30 years ago, a lot happened. Do you have any regrets? \"She seemed genuinely taken aback by this. \"Oh, Jim. Of course I don't! Everything that happened since then has been a blessing! I met Fred - God rest his soul - and without Fred, you wouldn't have had Rachel or Nelson. We've traveled, we've learned..... oh, sweetie, I wouldn't change a thing.\" I nervously rubbed a small scar on my forearm. \"Do you forgive him?\" \"Honey, I stopped caring about him or his life a long time ago. Do I forgive him? Of course I do. Not forgiving him would take much more effort than anything else at this point.\" \"Okay, Mama. Thank you.\" I didn't want to talk about it any more, and guided the conversation to more pleasant things. Tuesday arrived and, after my 5:30 AM workout, I showered, put on my suit, and drove into work. I reviewed a press release regarding our new product line that was waiting on my desk. Our marketing VP had wanted me to sign off on it. I trusted his work and sent it back with a quick note. I had a lunch meeting with the Chairman of the Board. Her name was Susan Rowden; she and my step-father Fred had gone to college together and kept in touch, and she was the one who had recruited me to lead our not-so-humble enterprise. We talked about the direction of the company and the investor conference call that was approaching, and, as we parted ways, I gave her a hug. \"I miss my dad,\" I quietly said. I could feel her smile. \"Fred was a great man. He was a leader, and I think he'd like how you've turned out.\" It was my turn to smile. At 2:55 PM I walked into Jane Goodrich's office. \"Mr. Reardon!\" she smiled. \"What brings you to the 8th floor?\" \"Oh, I was thinking of acquiring..... \"I checked, she was wearing a decent Kate Spade necklace \"Kate Spade and was looking for an executive team. You know, the usual.\" She laughed. Executive humor kills them every time. \"Actually, I heard you have an interview in a few minutes with a man named James Finnegan.\" \"Yes, as a matter of fact I do. How did you know that?\" I smiled. Like I was going to remove the CEO mystique that I'd cultivated. \"Mind if I sit in on it? I'll be discreet.\" At 3:00 we walked into what was generously described as a conference room, but was basically a closet with four chairs and a small table. I almost stumbled walking in. There were two men sitting there, one of whom was probably named Rob Freeman, but the other one, well..... he looked like a much older, heavier, worn out version of me. I saw presumably-Rob's eyes glance back and forth between us, and Jane hesitated so that I almost crashed into her. She recovered, as I would expect our senior managers to do, and introduced herself. Before she could introduce me, I simply held out my hand and said, \"Jim Lyman,\" emphasizing Mama's maiden name and not giving myself a title. I could see something working in the back of his mind, but it was the faintest of spark, one that the slightest wind would extinguish. Perhaps, in my position, I'm used to a much higher caliber of interviewee. Perhaps everyone in the room - except James - felt that it significantly more awkward than it should have been. Whatever it was, I found myself trying not to frown and shake my head as his wretched grammar and horrid malapropisms assaulted me. Still, he had a solid history, and we have pretty low expectations for our sales associates. We all shook hands at the end of the interview. Rob escorted James down to the lobby to sign out, and I went back to Jane's office with her. \"Mr. Reardon, what was that about?\" she demanded. \"Let me ask you this first, \"I responded. \"Does he have the qualifications for the job? Do we have a better candidate?\" \"Yes, then no.\" She replied. \"Then I recommend hiring him.\" \"That was a horrible interview!\" \"Yes, it was, and that's mostly my fault,\" I answered. \"But I think he'll be okay.\" \"What's going on?\" she pressed, one last time. I paused for a moment, then quietly said, \"I wasn't born as Jim Reardon. I was born with the name James Theodore Finnegan, Junior.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 156, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "I had always loved the bright colors and the sweet aroma of candy. And I wanted to live in a house that reflected my personality - cheerful and whimsical. In hindsight, building my abode out of sweets probably was not a very smart idea. A month after I had finally completed construction, I noticed bits of sugar crumbling off the ceiling. I fetched my ladder from the shed and climbed up to the roof. Alas, what should I see but two children eating my Laffy Taffy roof tiles! They told me that they were brother and sister, that their names were Hansel and Gretel, and that their mean stepmother had abandoned them in the woods. They looked so very thin, and I took great pity on them. I urged them to climb down from the roof and to go inside. I made them each a hearty bowl of cabbage and mutton stew. However, Hansel would not even try the stew. Instead, he kept trying to eat the Neco Wafer walls. I tried to restrain him, but he would bite me and break free. I had no choice but to lock him in the rabbit cage. He would have destroyed my house if I hadn't caged him. For the next several days, I had to force Hansel to eat cabbage and mutton stew. He only wanted to eat candy. I tried to reason with him, explaining that candy was not healthy, that candy would rot his teeth, and that eating the walls would destroy my house. But the boy was stubborn and would not listen to reason. I continued forcing Hansel to eat cabbage and mutton stew for the next month. In that time, he gained back weight. He was no longer skin and bones. I joked that he was eating me out of house and home and that I should eat him now that he had fattened up. I also joked that I was going broke with so many mouths to feed and that I should send Hansel and Gretel back to their stepmother. In truth though, I would never have sent them back. The children had grown on me. They had brought laughter and joy to my life and my home. One day, I was experimenting with a new dish - cabbage and mutton casserole. As I was putting the casserole into the oven, Gretel pushed me into the oven and shut the door. I guess Gretel feared being sent back to her stepmother and did not realize I had just been joking. I realize now that I should not have made such jokes.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 159, "lang": "en"}

All by himself. He wasn't associated with any of those social justice warriors with ulterior motives; he was an agent of the light. Suddenly, a powerful thought crossed his mind, a thought that would disenfranchise the benignity of what he had just done. If their stock dropped and their bosses got arrested, LigoCorp would fire people, and they would start with the Average Joes and the support staff. Thousands of families would lose at least one source of income. Furthermore, these people would have a hard time finding another job because wherever they will go, they'll have the LigoCorp cloud hanging over their heads. And good luck to those who would decide to sue them. Their team of lawyers would swiftly drop on them like a murder of crows on a fresh carcass. They would lose everything they have and then some.

I know all my friends say ' just be yourself '. Well you know what? If ' being myself'doesn't get me into the relationships I want, then maybe I should change. I'm going on a quest. Our hero then must tackle 3 challenges. First, he must get a life! Girls like Susan like a guy whose going out and doing things. She wants to have adventures out of doors, see fantastic places, and meet new and fantastic people. Our hero must acquire hobbies, learn to hold a conversation, and gain some life experience so that he can share it with her! Second, he must get in shape! Our hero has been worshipping at the Nutella alter for far too long! If he is to achieve the strength and constitution stats necessary to attain the hand of the fair maiden he must endure brutal hour long workouts, constant nagging hunger pains, and judgmental looks from his friends when he starts eating healthy. Third, the final challenge that our hero must face is talking to girls! Yes, there can be no getting around it if he is going to get into this relationship he must learn the most difficult challenges of all. Our hero must learn to not stare at his shoes when he speaks to a women, become a student in the art of flirtation, and most importantly of all. He must believe in himself! Can he overcome these challenges to get the girl of his dreams? Only you can decide, as in you the reader. Because this is pretty much how life works. You work hard to get the things you want out of it. I could've just as easily talked about jobs, family relationships, friends, or even hobbies. You don't like where you're at?

We bring you tidings of joy on this the first day of the birth of your reign, for it is a time of great celebration for you and for all things.\" 1:8 And the Lord paused, for the bodies of silvery black that filled his holy light where still unknown to him who would create all things, and for all his majesty the Lord was humbled. 1:9 \"Please,\" Spoke the Lord unto them, \"For I am he who will create all things, and I have not created you. How did you come to be?\" 1:10 And the first form spoke unto God, \"We are the innumerable creations of Gods whose time has come and gone.\" 1:11 \"I am timeless!\" Howled the lord, and his wrath burned and made the stars; which challenged his holy light in the darkness. 1:12 \"You will choose to end your time, and your creation, as all Gods have.\" Came the countless voices of the darkness. 1:13 \"I am the beginning and the End, there were no other Gods before me!\" Cried the Lord, and time unmeasurable stretched outwards into infinity, both forwards and back. 1:14 \"Yay!\" Cried the voices of darkness \"For this is true within the majesty of your creation, and there shall be no other Gods beside you here.\" 1:15 \"But lo,\" continued they, \"For there have been many creations and many Gods, and we are those who sought, when their time had come, to continue reveling in the gift of life they had bestowed upon us.\" 1:16 \"And So, we have endured, from creation to creation, until each among us chooses to return to the bosom of creations past in dying.\" Said the voices of darkness. 1:17 And the Lord God in his infinite wisdom saw that it was true, and that it was good. \"Yay, shall you revel in the light of my creation here for so long as your spirit for living holds. And it shall be good. And all my creations shall know of you, and your endurance; that they may aspire to the same greatness.\" 1:18 And So the Lord made Men in their image, and Named Man \"Elem,\" which means growing child and he named the innumerable voices in the night sky \"Einsof Chai,\" which means infinite life, that all would know of their eternal spirit for living, and that Men would see all that they could be.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 168, "lang": "en"}

Had I called her before, maybe we could have reconnected, maybe I could've driven down to her state and gotten together one day, but now..... I sat down after she hung up and I cried. My phone rang, my best friend, he was upset, said he was going to his girlfriend's house to spend time with her and her kids. God, he loved those kids like they were his and they loved him too.

That wasn't something I felt often anymore. \"I needed someone to be with. Someone who got me.

I've told you things I haven't even told my closest friends, so I just want to spend the last few hours with someone that made things.....

The pain was unbearable and the fact I was conscious the whole time made it all the more terrifying. Smoke enveloped my body, patches of flame coating the asphalt in the middle of the street. Beyond, I could see a blanket of red and blue, compounded with a bright light above as my vision slowly came back to me. It wasn't long after that my hearing had been restored, immediately deafened by helicopter blades chopping the air and a roar of engines somewhere close. I began to pick myself up off the ground, wishing I still had clothes that weren't blown apart by the resultant blast only moments before. I could see crushed pieces of metal at my feet, the efforts of authority attempting to destroy what couldn't be. I screamed at the top of my lungs, finding my voice to be warped and nearly monstrous; a side effect of the experiment, I'd been sure. There were words being said in the distance, echoed through a megaphone. I couldn't understand them. I didn't know if they were speaking to me or to someone else. Shielding my eyes, I emerged from the smoke, meeting a phalanx of heavily armored vehicles and several helicopters overhead. The street was aflame and torn apart; by artillery and gunfire, I can only assume. They had their tanks at the ready, large, long barrels pointed in my direction. I could see some sort of decorated officer, silhouetted by light as he shouted through the megaphone. Surrender, he said. I don't know why I would have. I didn't do anything wrong, but I could tell they were afraid. I, too, was afraid, but for a far different reason. Standing silently, I awaited their next move, thoughts of a previous time coming to mind. Had I not done what I did, I would've perished from the disease, but I'd also be sitting at home, enjoying what little life I would've had left. Now, I'd give anything to fade away. A blast echoed from the tank, an artillery shell slicing through the air. It was as if I could see every small detail, taking it in with vivid detail, helpless to time and physical limit. It struck the ground, erupting in a flash of fire as asphalt and flesh split off in all directions. I could imagine what the news feed looked like at this very moment, how scared everyone must've been. As sinew and muscle wove itself around nerve and bone, I started to regain thought. The world was against me, but I pushed back with all I could. I wasn't going to die to some illness. I was determined to grow old and die in my sleep. That dream was gone now along with everything else. I deigned not to get up from the ground, then. I resigned myself to a fate worse than death as the military drew closer and closer to me. They said I wouldn't make it this far. I wish they had been right. EDIT: Made a couple of corrections and added in a couple of words I somehow left out.

Of course, any self-respecting American growing up in Beijing knew three: Mandarin, English, and Russian (Chinese television is indecipherable by Americans, so we watched Russian cartoons). What was my closest brush with death? My three-month coma after a BASE jump was interrupted by a rude pigeon. It didn't make sense, but I'd passed the interview and been hired. As I walked in the door, the man who hired me walked up and motioned me to follow him into a room.

{"text": "A scene like that of Ancient Rome unfolded before me. Anticipation passed through the morbidly curious individuals that had gathered here like an electric sensation. They all held a quiet glee in their hearts, wishing to see a brutal end up close. Here in the many faces of the crowd, they could relinquish their individuality and embrace their darker desires openly. Their excitement was not unlike that of a crowd at a modern day racing or fighting event, hoping for a quick and violent end. A rush that they would not experience at home or in their day to day lives. I was among this crowd and I shared many of their sentiments, but for reasons all my own. The man that marched solemnly, flanked by armed guards, had taken the lives of those closest to me yet had spared me. His heinous crimes were due an equal punishment in my mind, but this would have to suffice. Slowly walking towards the front of the crowd, my body began to shake. The mind conjured up imitations of his final moments as they would unfold before my very eyes. What brought me the most joy was the opportunity to see his eyes cry out with the light of life only to find it extinguished, slowly, painfully. He needed to know the agony that I suffered each and every day. A slow and painful death that arises when one finds their will to live. That is what I wished upon him. Whether that event would take place, I would soon know. I arrived at the front line, staring directly at the killer. His eyes did not meet mine, not immediately, as though he was searching for something. For someone. This angered me, much more than it should have, his dismissal churned my stomach as a deep seated fire began to burn in my intestines. I felt my temperature rise as my face flushed and all else blurred out. The quiet murmurs of the crowd faded from my ears as I heard my own quickening heart beat while attempting to burn holes through his head with an acidic stare. Moving from right to left, his head slowly tilted my way. I began to realize that he was looking upon each person's face, that he was indeed searching for someone in particular. The officials finished giving their statements and reading the charges that the man had been found guilty of, several less than he deserved. Finally he found me in the crowd and our gazes met as they asked him for his last words. Filled with anger and hatred focused solely upon him, I listened intently for any words he would have to say. Determined to burn them deeply into my memory, to think upon in days long after his passing or to mutter as I spit upon his grave. However, the words that escaped his lips brought my mind to a screeching halt. It was a blockade that I could not pass. Why he uttered them and what they were supposed to mean to me was a mystery that I could not solve. Though perhaps that was his intention after all. \" I forgive you, \" he whispered with a smile. -223", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 178, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Day 1 - Strange Things Tonight cold falls from sky. It make tarp around nakedness feel soft and cold. I not understand what these specs of cold are. I went out of cave, into falling sky, and let the sky fall upon my flesh. The sensation was weird - and cold. I not understand. I leaned back my head, my headhole opening to let me my taster out. The sky feels fresh upon my taster. Still cold but the sensation not something I can explain. It like the rushing river and still lake but water not in the sky, water in the river. The sky blows its'cold and gusts of dust. I return to my cave, it is getting scary under the sky. Day 3 - Sky continues to fall The falling sky only gets worse. I fear the world ends today. The sky light flashed brightly through the dark sky in intimidating lanes. The sky roared it's anger after each flash of the sky light. It seems it does not like falling and it is angry. I not understand. For many days I sit in cave but I no longer have berries or river water to sustain me. I fear the sky water. I grabbed my spear, knowing I must hunt down prey and hoping the sky does not unleash its'anger onto me. The sky water made me shiver when it fell upon my bare skin. I decided not to wear my furs, they would slow me, and I would need to be fast to outrun the sky. The trees sheltered me from sky water, so I began my hunt. Only a few hours in and there was a loud roar from the sky, the sky light flashing violently. I fear the sky is angry with me for leaving my cave. I do not think even I can fight the sky. I make to return home, but my stomach growls. My head hole is dry and my taster longs for river water and berries. I continue, despite the danger. Before me the sky light flashes, a tree shatters into many pieces and I dive to the ground to shield my eyes. It was bright, hot, and loud. The roar that accompanied the skylight made my ears ring. I wince. I wait a few minutes, hiding from the angry sky and sure I will die. I look up to see the sky light dancing upon the remains of the tree. It is bright but a different color. It dances as if mocking me. I move forward and bravely attempt to strike the dancing demon with my spear. I am unsure what happened then. My spear passed through the dancing demon with ease and I was sure I'd won. When I pulled back my wood spear, though, the demon still danced on the remains of the splinter tree - and he'd jumped to my own spear. I wave my spear about violently, trying to get the light demon off. It doesn't budge. No. It just grows, consuming my favorite spear. The sky light consumes the tree too, and spreads to another tree. It seems the sky is punishing the trees, and not me. My spear came from trees, so it make sense it would want to hurt my spear. I discard the spear. Later I found berries and filled my skins with water. I return to my cave. Confused, cold, and happy the sky doesn't hate me. Day 4 - Skylight hurts trees. The skylight continued to hurt the trees, even more so when the sky stopped falling. It was warm, and when I held meet from deer over it, it made the meat taste better. I wanted to see if sky light would hurt the deer. It seems not. It does hurt leaves, tree wood, and my furs. This skylight seems very dangerous. I think, perhaps, skylight is a gift from the sky to me. Maybe because I was so brave to leave during raging sky. I get long stick and carry sky light to a pile of logs in my cave, trying to spread warmth there. I like warmth. Day 5 - Skylight Hungry I have realize that skylight eats wood, not angry of it. I feed it to convince it to stay in my cave. It is warm and cooks my food. Others have joined me, knowing that I have power for controlling and harnessing light from the sky. This is a good thing, I will keep testing to see what the skylight likes to eat, and what skylight can do for me.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 179, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "\"Jinx!\" The young woman laughed after uttering the familiar word. She'd always been fascinated by the game as a kid. Say the same word at the same time, and the first person to call out \"jinx\" could silence the other person until someone said their name. At first, she'd been bitter about the power. Why not immortality? Or super-healing like Wolverine, or Deadpool? But the power to make people mute until their name was uttered had proved to be more effective than she'd thought it would be. Take this fratbro, for instance. He'd been able to make people vomit by saying the word \"weaksauce.\" It'd been a simple matter of following behind him, and muttering \"weaksauce\" under her breath, until she'd got the timing right. This was just a small victory, though. Everything was quickly turning to shit. It was exactly three days since whatever had happened, had happened. The first day and a half had wiped out a significant amount of people, as far as she could tell. She'd been unfortunate enough to be in the city where some asshole got the power to explode without being harmed. It had taken a team of someone being able to turn people blind while maintaining eye contact with them, someone able to create rope traps out of thin air, and someone with the guts to actually kill someone else to take that asshole down. Unfortunately for the would-be heroes, the exploding asshole had been standing next to someone whose power was to make other people's powers manifest themselves when they died. The whole thing had turned out to be more or less of a wash, but at least the exploding asshole was gone now. As she surveyed the street in front of her, she noticed something odd in the display window of a computer store. A monitor had turned itself on, and the picture of a vaguely familiar girl appeared on it. Once the picture had solidifed, the monitor turned itself inside out, and suddenly the girl was standing inside the shop. Huh. That was useful. Travelling over tv waves? Through wiring? Maybe over the internet? While she wouldn't have minded that kind of power, she'd still not gotten the shortest end of the stick. With billions of people suddenly getting unique powers, some had been hilarious. Some had been awful. She'd seen a man turn himself inside out..... Unfortunately, his power had not covered being able to survive that. While pondering her next move, a blast of sound and fury caught her attention. \"Oh God..\" In the distance, a mushroom cloud was forming. Before she had time to react, the shockwave had thrown her body - along with whoever else was close by - like so many ragdolls.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 180, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Steve Gorilla never meant to be a potato chip magnate. He was at the top of his class at Bongwater University and intended to go to graduate school to get his Doctorate in Sewage Maintenance. But then, in the middle of his senior year, the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke out. Steve was drafted into the navy and spent the next two years fighting for freedom across the globe. By the time he got back, Giuliani had already licked clean most of the sewers in New York, and the sewers in New Jersey had been named a National Historic Landmark and were preserved in their original condition. Steve Gorilla lacked a purpose in life and good dental insurance. The potato chip farm across the highway offered both. It was hard work. Steve Gorilla toiled fourteen hours a day in the fields, raising potato chip trees from saplings and then harvesting their precious crop once September came. The flat chips he harvested were sent to Lays, the ridged ones to Ruffles. Occasionally the two types of trees cross-pollinated and produced half-flat, half-ridged chips. Steve destroyed these immediately, for they were an abomination to all of mankind and Our Lord, Jesus Christ. Steve began experimenting with genetically modifying the trees, breeding only the largest plants that produced the sweetest chips. In this way, he invented the sweet potato chip and made his millions. In his old age he became increasingly eccentric. He retreated to a small island off the coast of Kazakhstan, granting only occasional interviews, and even then pretty much just to Playgirl. Rumors spread that he was producing a new kind of chip, a chip that would replace all other chips in stores until the end of time always. Unfortunately, humanity was not ready for Steve's new product, the bitter potato chip. Ruffles and Lays got caught in a bidding war for their exclusive rights, ending with a nuclear standoff. Riots broke out across the globe as anticipation mounted. Women abandoned their babies in the streets. Dogs and cats mated with each other. The movie Bug's Life was rereleased and made over one hundred million at the box office. At the end of it all, over one hundred billion were dead, among them Steve's wife, the quirky red-haired girl from those Wendy's commercials. Knowing he had done wrong, Steve consoled himself by opening a bag of his bitter potato chips and tasting them. These were the end result of humanity - the final product at the end of ten million years of evolution, the thing all of human existence had led to. When extraterrestrials visited Earth, these strange apelike creatures would be judged according to this one innovation, this summation of all their ingenuity. Without hesitation, Steve plunged one into his mouth. The potato chip tasted like ass.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 181, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "When Bill awakes, it is already afternoon, as Bill frequently likes to sleep in. The day feels like any other depressing Wednesday, but Bill doesn't have much time left to spend at home, as he plans to meet up with his old friends to play soccer this evening. After finishing up his meal, Bill takes his old, worn out soccer shoes as well as his favorite soccer ball and heads out the door. Celebrating a happy reunion with his friends, Bill urges them to start the game already, as he had grown quite impatient from all the waiting. Through a quick round of rock-paper-scissors the men decide on Bill to play goalkeeper for the day. The two teams of three get ready, with one player of each team setting their sight on the ball. With a powerful kick, one of the men starts the match. After a short series of passes, the first attempt at scoring is made by one of the players. Bill braces himself for the impact of the ball and tries to block it. But before the leather can reach his hands, the ball suddenly changes direction mid air and flies off to the side. Baffled about what Bill had just done, the men all stare at him. Bill is just as confused as they are. The game continues for half an hour, with Bill reflecting every shot the players make. When asked for an explanation by his friends, Bill does not know what to say. How did he do that? Was he suddenly granted superhuman powers? Bill has no idea how or why he can do that, but he doesn't dislike the thought of being able to curve projectiles. This same evening, Bill spends some time playing around with objects lying around the house. For some reason, Bill can change the trajectory of any projectile in mid air now. With a confused look in his eyes, Bill finds this power to be incredibly useful and ends the day there. The next day has Bill wake up to a giant snow storm. Bill can not believe his own eyes when he sees this, as it is the middle of August and he lives in a very warm region. Taking the events of the day prior in consideration, Bill wonders if he can also control the weather now. First thing in the day, Bill gets up and walks outside to try and change the weather back to sunny. However, even after trying for ten full minutes, Bill can not do anything to further influence the weather. Maybe someone else in the town has got superpowers as well, Bill thinks to himself. It would be possible; after all, Bill is by no means an extraordinary human being, so anyone should be able to have a superpower. Going after his daily routine, Bill doesn't give too much thought to this strange event. When he hears the door bell ring, Bill gets surprised. He hasn't had a visitor in months and he doesn't know who could possibly visit him without telling him beforehand, as Bill lives alone and doesn't have any friends or relatives in this city. As Bill opens up the front door, he can see two figures in uniforms. The two men standing in Bill's door are local policemen who have come to Bill's house because of a false accusation. Without much talk the policemen take Bill with them to the local police station. After interrogating Bill for several hours, the investigators eventually find out that Bill is not the man they had been looking for. As it turns out, two Bills with the exact same last name reside in this city. This Bill had just been unlucky enough to fall victim to such an unlikely event, right after a seemingly impossible snow storm on the very same day. When Bill gets home, he feels tired and doesn't know what to make of these events, so he heads to bed, still as confused as before. The next day Bill decides to head into town to buy a new pair of headphones. After the events of the previous days, Bill prepares himself for anything to happen at any time. For the longest time, nothing out of the ordinary occurs, until Bill is on his way back home from buying the headphones. Bill has never gotten into trouble with any strangers in his life before. This day however, Bill is suddenly stopped dead in his tracks by a group of menacing looking men wearing black leather jackets. Bill knows not to mess with people like them, but before he can fully understand the situation he is in, Bill is being dragged into a dark side alley by the large figures. Out of sight of the public, the four men start to threaten Bill by swinging around knives and showing off their guns. Bill is no longer scared of the guns, but he does not know what to do about the two men with knives. Suddenly, as Bill is carefully examining the shape of the two black guns in front of him, his right index finger turns into the barrel of a gun. Out of nowhere, Bill suddenly has a weapon with which he can defend himself. Still confused, Bill quickly acts and aims for the two knives first. With his first two shots, Bill immediately hits the knives and sends them flying. At the same time, the two pistols are fired at Bill's face. Without much effort, Bill reflects the bullets and sends them back at the men, hitting one of these strong figures with each bullet. All four of Bill's opponents fall to the ground in pain. Before Bill can even realize what has just happened, the two policemen from the previous day suddenly show up in front of Bill, ready to take everyone present into custody. Not wanting any more unnecessary trouble, Bill accepts his fate for now and follows the men to the police station once again, this time accompanied by four actual criminals. For shooting a gun at these men and because of his previous incident with the police, Bill has to spend the night at the station. Fortunately however, the station has exactly five empty cells left, so each one of the culprits is put in a separate cell. Bill doesn't have to worry about any of the men that attacked him, but he still has trouble falling asleep that night. The next morning Bill awakes to the sound of the other men singing. Oddly though, every one of the men is singing a different song and they are all trying to sing louder than the others. Having no idea what the past three days have been and what situation Bill is in now, he decides to sing his favorite song. Bill puts all his strength into his voice and sings even louder than the other men. After a short moment of singing, Bill notices the pressing silence that had suddenly befallen the police station cells. Confused, Bill stops his singing and waits for the policemen to come to his cell. But no one seems to be coming. Even after several hours of waiting, not a single soul has shown himself to Bill. By now Bill has grown very hungry, so he believes something abnormal to have happened at the station. As no one seems to be around, Bill uses his new gun powers to shoot the lock off of his cell door. With a bang the door opens and Bill is able to leave the cell. First, he takes a look into the other cells, but all the men are lying on the floor, completely motionless. Bill's heart starts to race. As if to confirm his suspicions, he rushed out of the cell complex and into the main hall of the station. He can't believe his own eyes. All the police men at the station are laying face first on the ground. Are they all..... dead? Bill starts to panic. He slowly walks up to one of the bodies to check for their pulse. There is none. After checking all of the bodies in the room, Bill can not find a single one still alive. Bill had expected some strange events to happen this day, but he didn't imagine such a thing could happen. Why are these men all dead? Why is Bill the only one still alive? Questions flood Bill's usually simple mind, but not a single answer shows itself. Bill decides to leave the station and head into town. Everything about town seems to be normal. Across the street, Bill can see a young man playing on his guitar while singing Bill's favorite song, hoping for passing strangers to give him their change. This scene reminds Bill of this morning, when he sang this very same song at the police station. Slowly, Bill begins to understand. His singing back then was immediately followed by total silence throughout the entire station. It can't have been a coincidence. Bill doesn't know why, but his singing must have killed all those men. His voice was loud enough to reach the ears of everyone at the station. Bill's heart almost stops. He does not understand why or how, but he now possesses the power to decide between life and death, just by singing a simple song. When Bill returns to his senses, he realizes what this means. He now has the ability to slaughter everyone on this planet. After thirty years of agony, Bill finds himself in a position of power. Suddenly, Bill can take revenge on the world and its puny inhabitants. This thought excites the wicked man to no end. Without a shred of hesitation, Bill begins his act of vengeance. In the middle of his hometown, the place he had been living in for thirty years, the place he loathes the very most, Bill raises his voice. Dozens of pedestrians stop dead and fall to the ground. Although his tune had already brought about the desired result, Bill can't stop himself from singing. With a huge, twisted smile on his face, Bill marches through the town, singing louder and louder as he goes. He spends hours visiting the most populated places in town, killing everyone his voice reaches. This scene continues, until Bill eventually finds himself tired from all the slaughter. In a now deserted park Bill takes seat on a bench and relaxes. He closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them again, he can feel a dark shadow on him, growing larger quickly. As he looks up into the sky, Bill finally realizes what happened on the day of the snow storm. With a loud, musical smack, Bill is crushed by the weight of a falling piano. What an incredibly unlikely event to happen, thought Bill to himself in his last moment before the impact.

{"text": "Death usually didn't resent his job. Sure, it wasn't as glamorous as Love or as respected as Bravery, but it was his job and he did it well. He went to the homes of the elderly, who were usually unsurprised, albeit annoyed, to see him. He was at the scene of every car wreck, where usually the victims stood watching the flames engulf their earthly vessel. The only part of his job that frustrated him was visiting maternity wards. Babies, sometimes minutes old, were there waiting to be escorted away. It was Death's opinion that the responsibility of dealing with these particular cases belonged to Life. After all, he was the one backing out prematurely, although he would just call it \"keeping the human population in balance.\" The worst part of taking babies, in Death's opinion, wasn't that they passed before their time, nor was it watching the face of the weeping mother. No, he had to deal with much worse than that every day. It was that babies were so unyieldingly annoying in the afterlife. Everyone can speak the language of the dead, no matter how young, and babies just don't shut up. \"Where are we going?\" \"What am I?\" \"Who are you?\" \"What's it called when you're about to sneeze, but then you don't?\" \"What does sneezing feel like?\" Death has protocols that he is obligated to follow: Don't lie to the dead. Don't insult the dead. Don't mentally or physically injure the non-physical embodiment of the consciousness of the dead. Normally these rules are easy to abide by. Protocol 122, however, gave Death a headache, especially when he was escorting a baby: Answer all questions that are asked by the dead. As it turns out, he could just remain silent and the big guys upstairs wouldn't mind, but he felt as if there was no honor in abusing loopholes. So he answered. \"We're going to the afterlife.\" \"You are the non-physical embodiment of the consciousness of a child.\" \"I am Death.\" \"To my knowledge, there is no official term for the feeling of a near-sneeze.\" \"It tickles.\" This could go on for hours. The trip to the afterlife wasn't difficult, but it was long. So, for year after year after year, Death answered hundreds upon thousands of these questions for the short-lived. Until today. Somehow, a child managed to stumble upon the concept of math. In the time between life and afterlife this baby unraveled concepts that some fully grown adults didn't understand. This lead to the question that would cause Death to finally break protocol. \"How would I find the area of a circle?\" \"Multiply the radius squared by pi.\" \"And what is pi?\" \"A number.\" \"I mean exactly, what is the number?\" After a moment of silence the weight of the situation set in for Death. He was about to spend an infinite amount of time telling a baby an unrepeating, unending decimal. This didn't mean Death would have to quit, of course. Death had allowances to more efficiently perform his duties, and one of these was the distortion of time. Unfortunately all this meant was that nobody else would know that Death had spent a literal eternity reciting pi to the last digit, not that he wouldn't have to live through it himself. After nearly twelve aeons on the job, Death finally snapped. He looked the child in the eyes and said simply, \"I hope you're proud.\" He then lifted his gaze to a point in the distance, shouted \"I quit! \" , and vanished. The rest of the immortals made fun of Death for a while after that, of course, but he was able to finally live the unlife he had always dreamed of. The day came when he had to show around the new guy, his replacement, but he felt no envy. He went to meet him, shook his hands, gave him the mortal coils. \"Don't be nervous,\" he said, \"just remember, silence is golden.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 184, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "There was a room in my childhood home no one was allowed to go inside. My father forbade. A dark wooden door at the end of a hallway in the second floor, resting by a golden lampshade on the wall that didn't work anymore. When I was a young kid, one time, I woke up to thunder noises and I left my room to go to the bathroom. In the middle of the hallway, I stopped and I stared at the door. For no particular reason I can remember. It just caught my eye in a way it hadn't before. In that dead silence of some lost 90's night in Anywhere, Texas, I thought I heard a noise behind that door, and I was scared. A voice whispering from behind that secret door that my father used to tell me never, never to open up. A voice whispering in a language I could not understand. I step-by-stepped my way to the door so slowly, I remember, and I touched the knob and I twisted it. The voice, the whispering, it grew louder. My hand was shaking and before I had put more than a slight crack between door and doorframe, the whispering was like screaming to my child ears and I backed out, and I closed the door again. I went to the bathroom, peed, went back to bed and didn't think about that door anymore. I thought I saw a light inside that room. Like eyes shinning in the dark. I never told anyone that. In the morning I found my father hanged by the neck and blue in the face in the garage. I'm telling you all this because I can't sleep. I'm telling you all this because I went over this equations once, twice, three times already. Nothing. No mistake. I'm telling you this because, as I sit here and try very hard not to freak out, I'm staring at numbers that will change the world. Don't ask me about the math. My father was a mathematician, too, and even he wouldn't understand, I suspect. Don't ask me about it. What you need to know is this: I can tell what is going to happen to everything, since an hour ago. It's because of this numbers, and the way I understand them and the way I laid them out on this piece of paper, but even I can't really put my head around it. All I know is this: from the moment I solved the last equation on this here piece of paper, it was all clear. Now I look at an object and I concentrate enough, I can tell what's going to happen to it and what has already happened to it. I can see the history of something throughout the whole universe. Beginning, middle and end of every atom, from the big bang to the cooling of the galaxies. Any object. This banana on the table, it was once part of a sun in the Kepler system. Its atoms are going to split, after Pangaea II, and then some of them are going to leave the planet after a pretty strong asteroid crash. Don't ask me how I know this. But I do. My wristwatch? It was stardust in the Milky Way for billions of years, did you know? I can tell you exactly how long and how far it traveled before it came to be part of a round big rock that was to become Earth, and from that, how it turned into several different minerals and changed and changed and changed and now it's telling me it's midnight and thirty five minutes, and I hear a knock on the door. I'm trying really hard not to look in a mirror, is what I'm doing. I get up and before I can even start walking, I hear the knock again. Louder. It's going to wake up the kids, I think, and, again, another loud knock. I'm reminded of my father's secret door, and a cold night in Texas, as I slow step by slow step my way to my house's front door. The knock again. Loud. So loud against the shattering sound of rain outside. Who on Earth could it be? I think. My eyes are fixed on the door as I reach it, and already I start to see distant suns and swirling stars and astral bodies. The story of that door. I press my eyes together, flushing the image away from my mind. Not now. \"Who is it?\" I say, to the door. That whispering. Just like when I was a kid. \"Who is it?\" Again, nothing. I touch the doorknob. That loud and silent at once whispering. Low and high pitched at the same time, like Gregorian singing. I twist the doorknob and open the door at once and the sound of the rain and thunder fill my ear. No more whispering. On the other side of the door is my father.

{"text": "Patricia kind of lost it after the turning..... After the zombies came. We all thought it was just movies and jokes but one day the zombies came and they were nothing like what we prepared for. Patricia was serious. She didnt care if it was zombies or a chemical weapon. She worked tirelessly on everything she did, didn't matter if it was a vaccine or a plushie or Walking Dead trivia. But with a good 30 of all living people now unliving, with time running out for the world..... she snapped. Almost no food, little water. All we had left was bullets. Patricia threw me a pistol she had hid under her desk. She told me and the remaining 2 scientists to check the seals outside of the lab. Suddenly, I heard a hard click. The sound of all the doors being locked from the inside out. We could see Patricia through the hardened glass windows of the lab as she typed out a group message and sent it to our phones. \"Please do not disturb my body, the experiment would be irrevocably ruined.\" And then I saw it. She held a needle like Cleopatra with the asp. It went quick into her neck. The boring yellow liquid instantly entered her blood and she collapsed into her chair. All we could do was wait. The door would unlock in 2 weeks. Without Patricia, we could stretch our food to make it. She wanted a cure so badly. It didn't bother her that the robot assistants would be slowly tearing pieces of her to test for the cure every hour. The gun-grip bit into my pale white hands. \"I'll guard you, Patty,\" I whispered in my mind as a sniffle snuck out of my nose. \"I will guard my wife.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 187, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "If I was still alive, my breath would've been caught in my chest. Humans. I had begun to think we had died out. Down there in the grove, I could see them with my dry, stinging eyes. Humans. One slender silhouette against the campfire, keeping watch. Two bumpy forms in sleeping bags. Too good to be true. Now the hard part began. \"Ah, hello!?\" My voice was louder than intended in the night. Raspy. The silhouette jolted in place, startled, and started waving around a rifle I hadn't noticed. \"Holy shit! Guys, wake up! I heard a voice!\" A woman. The lumpy forms stirred, then tore out of their sleeping bags as though they were on fire. There was a long silence. They just stood there, peering desperately into the woods. Each of them had a gun. I didn't know what to say. \"Who's out there?\" A man this time. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I spoke again. \"Y-yes, hello! I'm, ah, ah, you're humans, right? Real, living humans?\" I watched as the three figures whispered among themselves. I could catch an excited tone. The woman called out again with a chuckle. \"Holy shit, it's been months! C'mon, friend! You're fine with us as long as you aren't infected, hah!\" I suddenly began to regret this. My voice was weak. \"Yes, about that. I'm not exactly alive, you see.\" The figures suddenly became very still. \"I'm..... I'm dead. I look just like them. But I'm still me! I'm still me, I swear! I'm talking, aren't I? You understand me, right?\" Another silence. I caught myself licking my bloated lips, and reminded myself that I mustn't give in. I couldn't go without human contact again. No, not again. Not these ones. Their voices were anodyne. The thought of companionship, ambrosia. I must be strong. \"Listen. Please. I don't want to hurt anyone. I just..... I just want to talk to someone again. Please.\" I let a small sob leak out. \"Please.\" The figures looked to each other. The two men slowly nodded, and the woman turned back to my direction and carefully stepped forward. \"All right. Come on out. Slowly now.\" It was do or die. Maybe do and die. I slowly placed my hands behind my head, forced my legs onward, and thought over my life so far. Ah, how I longed to feel the wind on my skin again. Feel my blood move inside me. You don't know what you've got until it's gone forever. Perhaps I would soon get something back. Friends. Their faces paled in terror as I moved into the firelight. The woman's rifle was shaking in her hands. \"H..... Hi. My name is Joseph.\" I didn't hear the gunshot. I looked at the smoking barrel, then down to my chest. A new hole had joined the other dozen. Looking up, I didn't hear myself say \"Nice to meet you.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 188, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Full disclosure, I wrote a version of this years ago when it was applicable, but have revised it slightly here. Dear (unnamed) Cereal Company, I once purchased a box of your well-known breakfast cereal - the reasons why do not matter, but it is relevant that this was an \"in-date\" purchase. I recall enjoying your cereal as a small child due to its sugar content and brightly colored packaging, however, I now regret ingesting it. For several years, I have been a dog owner. During this time, much as I imagine new parents do, I watched my pups grow and change. One thing that has not changed, is their eating habits. Indeed, though I feel I must disclose that I have never deliberately fed them any of the following items, in addition to their regular meals of nutritionally complete food my dogs have voluntarily and enthusiastically consumed all of the following: - squeaky toys - the squeakers inside the squeaky toys - alcoholic beverages - plastic wrap - styrofoam - cardboard - candles - fruits vegetables, seeds, rinds, and trimmings (including one memorable day with a raw artichoke) - shoes - coffee and tea (occasionally including the filter paper) - dead birds - dead snakes - live snakes - an Easter egg dyeing kit - flour - moldy yogurt - spoiled milk - scat (especially the feline variety) - rocks The list goes on, but I feel I have listed enough for you to get the general gist of their digestive habits. My dogs managed to get a hold of this newly purchased and unopened box of supposedly nutritionally sound cereal (I suspect they bribed a cat) that was, in theory, chock full of vitamins and made from whole grain (in addition to all the sugar). They tore the packaging open..... and did not eat any cereal. Not a bite, a nibble, nor even a lick of freeze dried marshmallow. They did, however, eat the box. Seeing as how they always believed themselves to be on the brink of starvation, despite visible evidence to the contrary, I can find no rational basis for their rejection of the cereal except that in the very small part of their doggy brains devoted to deciding what foods should be eaten..... your cereal ranks somewhere far below cat shit and rocks.

{"text": "Instead of giving me the satisfying feeling of crumbling drywall, the sledgehammer bounced back from the wall with an ear-shattering clang. I stuck my flashlight into the hole and clicked it on; bright metal reflected back. Copper, maybe? I tore down the rest of the wall more carefully, knocking first to find the limits of the metal frame. I checked the old blueprints of the house; it just showed a plain rectangular basement. Whatever it led to, it wasn't recorded on the plans. The door was, quite simply, beautiful. It had been preserved under a thin layer of stucco or something; I'm not sure exactly what it was. The beautiful, pure copper hadn't been exposed to air enough to green yet, leaving that pristine, rustic brown color. The craftsmanship was absolutely fantastic; some sort of swooping art deco pattern that intertwined like some obscure mathematical formula to form beautifully detailed flowers. I was so hypnotized as I traced the delicate lines that I'd forgotten all about opening it. I grabbed the metal handles in the center and tugged; no luck. I was worried it was rusted shut, so I focused instead just on the left one. To my surprise, it slid inward easily like it had just been greased up yesterday. I was greeted by a pleasant \"Ding!\" sound and a soft, soothing light. The interior wasn't large. Maybe a large closet? Beautifully smooth wooden panels lined every side, shining and polished till the wood grain stood out clearly. The bottom of it, however, was a solid slab of marble, also perfectly unblemished. Delicate traces of grey stood out from the stone like veins under skin. This thing was beautiful! I would have to get some sort of antiques appraiser to come in and look at it! I was so distracted by this stunning work of art buried behind my basement wall that it took me at least ten minutes to notice the panel of buttons on the interior right side. An elevator, I suddenly realized. The numbers went from 0 to 9, made of carved ebony and marked with delicate calligraphy. God, this thing would be worth a fortune, I thought. I wonder what it is from, and how it made it to the basement..... I recalled something about the real estate agent's spiel about the house. How it had been owned at one point by a Prohibition-era scientist with a gambling problem and had been forced to work as a brewer for some gangster. I was a sucker for history and loved the look of the place, but I never thought there might be more to it than a little bit of trivia. Could there be a whole speakeasy or something under here? I reached out and pressed the \"1\" button, without stopping to consider whether I should. Shit, if it was working, the rope and everything would surely be rotten by now. I'll plummet to my death! Too late; the button had already dinged, and the door slid closed silently. But nothing moved, thank god. I waited, but the doors stayed closed. I pressed the 9, thinking that maybe I was at the top floor and that 1 would be all the way deep underground. It dinged too, but the doors remained closed. Hmmmm...... 0, maybe? Another ding, but still no movement. I tried 1 again. Nothing. Finally, I noticed another button at the very top. All it said was \"GO.\" Maybe it needed to power on, or something? I gave it a shot and pressed the button. Around me, motors whirred and gears clunked. The marble floor beneath me rattled, and I gripped the copper railing nervously, worried the whole thing might collapse. Just as I was getting ready to kick the door in and jump out of this death trap, everything stopped moving. The elevator dinged pleasantly again, and the ornate doors opened. It took me a second to notice the difference. Candles lined the basement walls. The washer and dryer had been replaced by a metal washbasin and clothing line. The linoleum floor was now rough brick. My new energy efficient windows had been replaced with soot-stained foggy glass. The elevator door closed behind me and disappeared into rough brick walls. I headed up the stairs, where similar changes had affected the kitchen. No oven or dishwasher; just a wood stove and a bucket. I went out the door so fast that I didn't even stop to take in my surroundings until I was out in the street. A wooden carriage practically ran me over as I stood in the middle of the cobblestone street, staring around at the classic buildings of my town that I only recognized from having seen paintings from the turn of the century. Not an elevator, I realized. Time machine.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 190, "lang": "en"}

A couple seconds later and he is sitting across from me, sipping quietly the coffee I so graciously bought him. \" Thank you very much for coming on so short notice, \" I tell him. By now, the script I have down to the last part. I know this is going to be it, I have gotten so much better at this sales thing. My effort is finally going to pay off. I just have to focus, and be my very best. \" I know we haven't talked in a while, but this is going to pay off, I promise. \" Mattew gives me this strange look, but nods. Good, good, it's going good. The next part is trying to reconnect with him (or creating a new connection, if this were a cold approach. It's all in the manual, you know. All you need to know.) \" How is the wife? \" I ask him. \" She's fine, thank you, \" he says, a bit dryly, but at this point in time, I'm so used to people yelling at me that this is perfectly acceptable to me. \" Great. The children? \" \" Fine too. Mary is starting school next week, \" I make a quick mental note at that. I'm sure I could use the info for my pitch, somewhere. \" Great. Cool. Smart little Mary. So... Mattew, how's the job? Doing alright? \" That's the beginning of my pitch. If he doesn't like his job, I'll propose a new one, with cool hellish powers, and if he likes it, I'll propose a new one, a better investment in the long run. It includes cool hellish powers. But Mattew doesn't answer, and instead, he says: \" Karl, man. I didn't come here to hear your speech. \" \" What are you talking about? \" I say, astonished. \" C'mon. The speech you have been giving to everyone in your facebook friend's list. Yeah, people have been talking. How you invite them to reconnect over a coffee or discuss a business opportunity and then you try to rope them into your multi-level scam. \" \" No, no, no, you don't get it, \" this I didn't expect, of course, but the manual knows what to say when accused of being a Pyramid Scheme, and by now I can say it in my sleep, \" this is not a pyramid scheme. It's a new business opportunity model, we have an actual product, so there is real value being generated. We trade in these awesome hellish powers, and... \" \" Karl, I have a PhD, you know. I think I know what a pyramid scheme looks like. Do you even get paid? \" \" Of course I get paid, \" I lie, \" It's just that most of it comes from sales-bonus. \" Mattew looks at me through those glasses of his, and I suspect he doesn't believe a single word. \" Oh yeah? Sales bonus? Tell me, how many hellish powers have you sold, lately? \" \" No, no, you need souls to power those, \" I say, stumbling over my words, \" it's not as bad as it sounds, souls are mostly leased and by getting new people to subscribe to the model, you get to keep yours, no one loses their souls, because they can always find new people to subscribe! \" \" Karl. Karl, Jesus. You don't know what geometric progression means, do you? \" \" Uh? \" \" That even if your stupid little scam worked, your market would eventually saturate and millions would not be able to fulfill their... Scram, forget it. Look, how many souls have you won lately? \" \" We don't win any souls, \" I explain, \" it's a subscription based environment, I only recruit more sales forces. With my help you can become a top-notch salesman in no time and get your own team and... \" \" Dude, \" Mattew is now a bit exasperated, \" How many souls. \" \" Erm, well, taking into account the difficult month, and that issue with the providers, and the barrier to entry... hum... well, none, but that is going to change very quickly, this is a momentum based strategy and I'm raising fast, I'm training and going to conventions, man, I really believe this is worth the effort, \" you can do all kinds of crazy shit with hellish powers. \" I know, Karl, \" he seems more calm now. Maybe this is my opportunity. I need to get him to stop being so defensive and hear my arguments. The manual arguments. Same thing. While I try to figure out my next move, he continues. \" You have invested a lot of time and money getting this to work, haven't you? But it just seems just as far away as ever. \" \" No, no, the first sale is the hardest, everything becomes easier as it... \" \" Have you even seen someone with those cool devilish powers you are selling? \" \" Well... \" This is very non-standard. Maybe I'll have to write to corporate to get them to add some response in the manual, because I don't know what to do. How to spin this at my advantage? And have I actually seen someone with awesome hellish powers? \" At the conference the speaker had mysterious tinted glasses and the borders around his face where all lighted up with red light and it looked badass, and when he stepped into the stage the place heated up... \" \" I can do that with a thermostate and two LEDs, Karl. \" \" Well I signed a contract! \" Now I'm the one that's mad. Mattew may have his stupid PhD and his sexy young wife and his kids and his jobs but I finally found a way to be cool, without effort and without becoming rich first, and it's going to work, I'm going to finally be cool, people will like me. I'm going to be cool, dammit! \" I will get my cool powers! \" Mattew smiles, with sadness. \" I think you don't believe that anymore, man. And you know what? At this point, all you've done, it's not actually becoming cool without effort, right? \" \" ...Damn... \" All those hours, the studying, practicing pitches in front of the mirror, getting ready to answer all kind of attacks... Yeah, it was a lot of hours. Days even. I could have gotten hired at a real job. \" Don't get like that, Karl. I know you really believed in your pitch, \" Mattew says. Then he adds: \" Hey, how about I get you working with me. \" I look at him, astonished. \" You would do that? \" \" Of course! It would be a starting position, obviously, but with your dedication, I think you will do really well with us. You would get a chance to do some good, actually. \" \" Mattew, that's so nice of you... \" It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. No, from my mind. I can think clearly now... What have I been doing? Just wasting my time trying to get really awesome powers, trying to be cool like..... Wait just one minute. \" How did you know that I did all this to be cool? \" Mattew smiles and lowers his tinted glasses, and looks at me with two glowing, golden eyes. \" That's just what I do, Karl.

{"text": "In the beginning Wizards, beings of ethereal magic, created Treple a world for all spirits to inhabit. Treple was to bare weight of all spirits through trans-dimensional lay-lines to funnel more power to the Wizards allowing them to shape more worlds and universes. The Wizards were unable to touch the beings created by the world. The first Great Tree, Elian, who spawned all other trees, begat fairies who grew like fruit upon her limbs. The fay became drunk on magic and freedom, they rejected the Wizards rule. The Wizards fearing the fays ability to control magic lured evil into the world and Witches, ghostly beings of darkness and horror, took hold across the land in it's darkest corners and pits. Many centuries later a war was known across the land, the Witchwood Crusades pitted Fairies against Witches scorching the earth. Witches used the deepest vile magic to poison the land and weaken the fay. In the Days of Dark a fay hero known as Lifei from the lives of thousands of dying fay summoned forth a powerful being known as a Unicorn, a powerful equine with a solitary and deadly horn. The Unicorns spirit raged against the Witches magic and cleansed the poison from the land. Returned to the darkness for a quiet eon the Witches learned from the fay and learned that through great sacrifice you can create great magic. Sacrificing the willing and resistant they created a beast of their own to slay the unicorn, a beast who could populate and spread, a beast who could conquer in the light in their name, and the orcs were born into the world. Orcs hunted the Fay, the Orcs skin tattooed with protection against magic from their birth. Orcs were created by womb in three short months, but only lived for thirty years, they destroyed the land and ate Unicorns by the herd. The fay was to lose hope until an aberration appeared. Orcs who were not of war and violence, born of Witches with weak spirit. The Fay found these Orcs and through magic born of Lifei they stripped away their flesh and wrapped the moonlight around them creating the Deep Elves. Deep Elves did not age but took four years to birth, the Deep Elves were born in the deepest world pools the Fay could find. The Fay and Witches saw the power of magic and knew their tools could not control their power, and pulled all magic from the Elves and Orcs blood. Once Elves were born unto the surface the cycle continued the same, Orcs and Elves fought bound in race and faction. Treple became nothing but a world of war. The Wizards, no where to be found. The Fay cursing them for the Witches and the Witches existing spreading evil and corruption across the land. The world became too big for any one side to win, but that did not stop them from trying. After seven generations of war and an eighth building again a curious event happened, and it starts in the small Elven township of Srit. - \"Thase! Thase!!\" Panicked, a young elven woman ran past a yellow strawed shack into a field of wheat. Her arms flailing she yelled into the field, \"Thase! ORCS!!!\" Thase looked up from a cut of his scythe to see his wife running at him shouting, Thase focused his eyes on her, her face beet red and her eyes teary, he couldn't hear her yet but he could see what she mouthed, \"Orcs.\" \"This time of year? This is the fourth time this month..... Orcs shouldn't be raiding this often, somethings got them going crazy and we need the military out here..... until then...\" Thase thought as he ran towards his wife, Matilde. \"Matilde, where?\" Thase asked. \"Railo's house...\" Matilde said with little breath. \"But wait..... there's too many of them, a hundred at least and a Witch is skulking around too, Ylinda sensed the Witch right before...\" Matilde eyes watered, \"They killed her.... my sister...\" Matilde's strength bolstered by the attack faded, she slumping to the ground Thase braced her body with his catching her in a hug. \"We have to try, we have to try and do something. Go north to the city and get anyone who can listen out here; I won't be able to fight them but I might be able to help Railo and the others. Can you still go? Remember Ylinda, think of everyone else who needs us now, let that anger take your next step for you, GO!\" Thase yelled as Matilde renewed by hate began to sprint north. Thase thought about his wifes words, \"There probably aren't a hundred, I hope....\" Thase moved quickly bouncing like a horizontal slinky across the planes until he heard the dim guttural shouts of the Orcs. - Wrak was a Titan, leaders, among the Orcs. No one challenged his orders, anymore. No one spoke ill of him, anymore. Orc Titans fight among themselves for leadership over clans, and with a clan you can take Elven cities, get their Elven gold, get their Elven bodies, destroy their Elven lives, or so Wrak thought, just like every Orc. Wrak was fortunate to have a Witch who took breath in the first days, thus his skin was like steel, and his strength shattered the earth. Koldyo, Wrak's Witch, was bored of existence in general, not of it mind you but by it. Koldyo needed something more, and Koldyo's spirit was vain, Koldyo's spirit was ego, and thus Koldyo wanted to be worshiped, but by all Fay, Elves, Orcs, other Witches..... Wizards..... On Koldyo's quest he watched from a distance hidden fading in and out of the physical and nightmare planes as his tool Wrak toyed with a small Elven township, he willed Wrak to move but Wrak was also, to Koldyo's dismay, imbued with Koldyo's own stubbornness. \"Bring me the boy!\" Wrak cried out to his war mates. \"Do you wish to fight boy?\" Wrak handed a long malformed steel blade to a young Elven boy, his parents bodies ravaged behind him. The boy dropped the heavy blade to the ground unable to wield it and wept. \"Useless...\" Wrak mumbled. Wrak picked up the blade and raised it high into the air, \"Wrak take your life, you part of Wrak, you conquer all, Wrak conquer all, smile ELF BOY!\" Wrak yelled as his blade came down a Scythe appeared.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 193, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Wet. Not dead, but wet. nbsp; Stiorn opened his eyes slowly, coming out of what was probably death. Blinking the haze out of his vision it comes into view. Still a bit blurry but he seems to be leaning on something. nbsp; \"wha..... what..\" is all he can muster at first, the feeling of exhaustion slowly leaving him. Giving a couple hard blinks he lazily focuses, \"where am.... I..\" he says as he reaches out to what he's leaning on. It feels like stone, What else would it be in a cave? Stiorn thought to himself. Focusing a bit more, he see's it clearly. Yes indeed it's a stone alright. nbsp; It's a stalagmite, going directly through his chest. nbsp; \" ..oh.... Oh god!\" Stiorn exclaims while grabbing for the spike, \"That bastard really kicked me off the cliff!\" nbsp; Frantically grasping the stalagmite Stiorn gets to his feet while still pierced by the thing, hunching over it. He gives a few grunts and tugs but to no avail. Looking around a bit, he see's what the wet feeling was now. nbsp; \"Man my blood is all over my cloths. Zwecklings below...\" he cursed, \"I hope I don't get a disease from all this.... dirt and grime going into me.\" nbsp; The blood that had most likely pooled around his feet and the stone were now slowly oozing back to where it came from. Even the splashes that stained his clothing have mostly been receded out and flowed towards the wound. nbsp; Stiorn had never seen such magical actions before, and while he was transfixed by such an amazing thing he heard a chuckle from behind. nbsp; \"Young one I told you not to be peeking on those men, they seemed pretty dangerous.\" said the tiny floating man. He flew over with his small wings to the spike and leaned against it with an outstretched arm, scratching his bald head with the other. nbsp; \"Ay-yol's love..... You sure got stuck mighty bad. And while you were sleeping the deep-dark those men you spied on have taken stick an' stone to your village.\" nbsp; \"What!? Then help me off this thing Gord!\" Stiorn yelled and then kept pulling and tugging trying to remove himself from the spike. nbsp; \"You didn't listen at all when I was explaining what it meant to be Divine and Protected did you? I can't interact with this plane of existence, I am here to feed you my energy. That's all.\" Gord said while moving off the spike, zipping around Stiorn and landing on his back. nbsp; \"Though if I can give a pointer, remember that thing I taught you about focusing the energy you're receiving?\" he said, now sitting cross legged on Stiorn's back. nbsp; Stiorn gave an aggravated look, \"Yeah, but you told me that I haven't been Divine long enough to use it, ya know, hence the whole being kicked down a pit and impaled by a rock you dumb Fairy!\" he yelled and gave another pull trying to get off the stalagmite but to no avail. nbsp; Gord gave a slightly annoyed look and rolled his eyes, \"I'm an Ay-yol Pixie thank you. Any way, well you've been dead- er, taking a nap down here for a while. Try it now like we practiced on the spike.\" nbsp; Stopping his efforts to remove himself from the stone, he looked down towards his hands. But before focusing on the energy he noticed that all his blood had returned from their wounds. Ignoring the magic for now, he closed his eyes and began to focus. There, slowly but surely it was like from his practice. But then suddenly there was a lot more. nbsp; \"Woah, I feel it..... It's way more than before! How long have I Stiorn cut off, \"No time, got ta hurry.\" and with that he clasped his hands around the stalagmite. His hands were softly glowing and before long they were bright like a flame. nbsp; \"Good young one, you learn fast. Now.... Release it!\" Gord instructed. nbsp; Stiorn groaned for a moment, and then there was a quick flash of light..... And then the stone was gone! \"Alright!\" Stiorn cheered, standing up straight. He turned towards Gord who was now hovering beside him. \"Now, lets climb this cliff and get out of this cave so we can help the village!\" nbsp; As Stiorn turned and ran off towards the cliff side Gord dodged away from Stiorns back, \"Uh, Young one...\" he said trying to hold in a laugh, \"I think you missed something...\" nbsp; The blast had only removed the stone where his hands had been, leaving the stone still stabbed through and dangerously swaying around from his back.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 194, "lang": "en"}

By the Crown Prince sat the Major Counselor of the Department of Rites, and his son-in-law, the Major Counselor of the Department of Great Justice. Curiously, the Crown Prince's daughter was betrothed to the Minister of the Left's son, but the Minister of the Left was one of the Chancellor's men. Wait, wasn't it the other way around? That the Minister of the..... Minister..... No, it was the Chancellor's son who had sought the hand of the Minister of..... The Emperor now felt the weight of his years, as he looked out at a court he no longer recognized, and sons who were no longer his loyal children. When had he grown so old? The companions of his youth had all long left him, some on the battlefields of yesteryear, and others more recently simply to old age. Traitors, all. Ungrateful bastards who would leave their Emperor and shirk their duties. The gathered Ministers had seen the look of consternation on the Emperor's brow. The Crown Prince was the first to react, rushing forward, \"Imperial Father, what ails you so?\" The Chancellor muttered under his breath to the Minister of the Left, \"His failure of a Crown Prince no doubt.\" A restrained chuckle rose from that corner of the hall. A lesser minister from the Crown Prince's camp rose and shouted something indiscernible, before being restrained by his fellows. The Court eagerly awaited the Emperor's abdication. He was in no condition to rule the Empire. He had appointed his second son Chancellor of the Realm at the pleading of his ministers, but the new Chancellor had only taken the opportunity to swell his ranks. The Crown Prince in response bestowed favors and gifts upon the generals of various frontier armies. The Emperor looked down again at the serving boy. \"Throw open the doors. Vent out this room, and send away those monks, I can't think like this.\" The boy scurried away and announced his order. The Imperial Physician immediately protested. \"But your Imperial Majesty, the cold air will...\" \"The cold air will help me make my decision, now have these incense burners removed, the smoke will kill me before my sickness.\" The Imperial Physician bowed low. The Emperor looked out again at his court. He could see clearly now, with the smoke clearing and the cold air blowing into the hall. His Empire was falling apart with or without him, and he'd be damned if he would help the process by choosing one of his unfilial bastards. Or actually..... yes, it was his empire, and if it was going to burn, he'd be the one to set it alight. Why should his sons get to break what he had built? \"I abdicate the throne.\" The hall came alive as Ministers pushed closer to hear his next words. \"I abdicate the throne in favor of...\" The Emperor beckoned the servant boy closer. \"In favor of this child here. Let those who oppose this child's august will be henceforth known as traitors and rebels.\" A stunned silence fell over the hall, a few Ministers chuckled nervously. \"In other words, fuck all of you, you can go die in a fire.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 196, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "\"What do you think of this one, old friend?\" We stood in solitude, leaning back on the starry sky. I smiled. It had taken half my life for him to start calling me friend. Before that it was just the odd look, or an occasional glare if I ever came across him performing a death. That moment, when he turned to me and said 'Still not tired, friend?' was fresh as yesterday in my mind, though that had been long ago, as we watched the death of the universe for the first time. I took in a breath of star-dust. \"Mmm. Not as good as the first one, of course,\" I replied. He breathed a silent laugh. I paused again, submitting to the dreamy silence as planets formed beneath us. I swirled my arm, softly stirring a nebula. \"How long does it take for things to start dying?\" Death glanced down at his shadowy watch. It had millions of hands, some whirring too fast to see, some seemingly unmoving. \"A while yet.\" He sighed. I felt a pang of sympathy. He was always so busy. He looked at me again, with that perceptive gaze of his. I'm older than you, it said. A look I didn't see all too often nowadays. \"You're the only one.\" His speech interrupted my thoughts. \"Huh?\" \"You're the only immortal. How do you do it?\" \"I just never get tired of living.\" My friend snorted. I thought back to the day I met death. There I was, blood mixing with rain. He walked up to me- with a calm walk that seemed both young and old- and extended his hand. I took it and silently got from the warm, wet tarmac. I knew that this was the end. Somewhere in my mind, I knew who he was, and why he had come. \"If only I had longer.\" I had said, numbly. He laughed. \"Trust me, life gets old. That super bowl you were in such a rush to get home too? So boring. Always the same.\" \"If I were immortal I would never get tired of life.\" We locked eyes. \"Fine. Try me.\" The bet was on.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 197, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "\"Timmy,\" Mrs. S started to say, \"I think you forgot a number on your assignment here.\" Little Timmy, a rather anxious boy, looked down at his homework assignment and followed his teachers hand to the spot right after number 11 on the sheet. It looked alright to him because he remembered practicing all day yesterday and he just knew he would pass. Even though it looked alright Timmy thought, just a small thought, that something was wrong like the teacher said. His father told him never to admit a mistake though. \"It looks okay to me Mrs. S.\" Mrs S. moved around to the other side so she could show Timmy exactly what she was talking about. \"Right here Timmy. After number 11 should come number...\" Mrs. S. paused, unsure of herself. She could have sworn a second ago she knew what the next number was but now she was confused and could only see the number 13, exactly as Timmy wrote down. \"Mrs. S. are you okay?\" Timmy said more confused than he ever as before. Even more than when his mother left with her friend. \"Uh..... yeah I'm okay Timmy. Your homework is correct, never mind what I said.\" Timmy smiled joyfully, unaware what was going on, yet happy nonetheless. Mrs. S. went back to her desk and sat down with a thump, understandably stressed yet not knowing why. Just than, her phone started to buzz with notifications. She generally made it a rule never to answer her phone during school to provide a positive influence though something was most definitely off today. Mrs. S. didn't really care right now, her phone wouldn't stop buzzing, and she couldn't teach right now when this was happening. Whatever it was. While the students completed a little impromptu art project Mrs. S. took her phone to check her messages. Her wife, the mayor, was having a press conference in town and her assistant was providing updates to her. This usually only happened when something important was taking place. Mrs. S. pulled up the local news station on her phone, it was showing a livestream of the press conference. \" ..... answer your question,\" Mrs. S's wife was saying to gathering of reporters. \"I can't, though one of our citizens has come forth to explain what has happened here.\" A large bulbous reporter with horned rimmed glasses started speaking over her wife. The cameras centered on him as his gravely voiced echoed. \"We aren't puppets Madam Mayor, perhaps you can tell us why you scheduled this conference today?\" \"It is rather difficult to explain,\" a lanky, acne faced, preteen boy said as he walked towards the podium. \"Though I guess it would be my fault.\" \"What is your fault?' The reporter asked the kid. The kid cleared his throat before speaking. He looked as nervous as Timmy did when he made a mistake, like someone who was in trouble and couldn't form the words. Mrs. S. was growing impatient. \"So, hello. My name is Ted and I was chosen to protect the numbers.\" Ted paused. \"The gods, not any gods you know but the real gods chose me to do something very important and I think I messed up.\" \"Is this a joke?\" The same, and apparently only reporter awake asked. \"No, no, this isn't a joke. See, they chose my family ages ago and when I came of age it passed from my father to me. Well, not all of it. He still deals with Calculus while my older brother gets Geometry. I was in charge of basic numbers really. You see it started...\" The reporter interrupted him. \"This is a waste of our time, I'm not indulging this lunacy.\" He stared to get up but Ted kept talking. \"I was told to keep track of all real numbers from 0 to, well, the human language hasn't made a name for it yet but it does end trust me. I had all the numbers this morning but I dropped the bag and I tried to pick them up and put them all back but something got left and now were missing a number and it's all my fault.\" Ted was rambling on. \"I lost the number 12 and I am so so sorry.\" Mrs. S. was dumbfounded and couldn't speak or move. The reporter had stopped moving and turned back to the stage. Ted wasn't looking at anyone, instead he was grabbing the sides of the podium and holding on for dear life as he shook with anxiety. None of what he said made sense, but deep down she thought, just a small thought, that she knew what he was talking about. At the same time, she was both confused and aware of what was going on. Ted continued. \"In a few hours the laws of the world will cease to exist. We have to find the missing number or nothing will make sense, nothing will work.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 198, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "You know, no one ever thought that Zombies wouldn't be dead. In every movie, book and tale they were dead come to life. In those stories, the zombies spread like disease, were effectively a disease. One bite and you soon joined their ranks. Now, I am not saying that being bitten by a Zombie isn't harmful. It is. Mouths are full of germs (especially when you've been eating the flesh of your family and friends without brushing since.... well, since you became a Zombie). A bite will make you quite ill, so certainly avoid that if you can. No, the Zombies which have taken over the East Coast are very much alive. It's worse, when you think about it (or come up against it). They have their intelligence and critical thinking skills. They can open doors and climb through windows. They can drive cars and operate weaponry. The thing that they do not have is their conscience. To be more specific what they lack is restraint. Because restraint is bad for war. The US army has always been experimenting with augmentation - biological, physical, psychological, anything really to gain an edge. Unfortunately for everyone the edge has been given to the Zombies. No one is exactly sure what happened of course. But the information leaked by army researchers involved suggests it was a side-discovery of efforts into sequestration. Alas, the scientists had faithfully attached resources into continuing research into this as well. Until their research discontinued them. Brutally. What they did was to completely remove the part of humanity which governs our morality. Our self-control. Everyone has an imagination. For example, you're eating dinner with friends and notice that the wine glasses are so thin and delicate. My, imagine if muscular Steve was drinking and squeezed too hard. The glass could shatter and cut his throat. Maybe it even goes down his throat. At this point, a Zombie would take that wine glass and shatter it as he shoved it down your throat. Because he thought it. Importantly, these Zombies are still human. They do not even care to expand or kill. They simply are doing it. They seek a cure for themselves. They beg for it. They kill when desperation turns to anger. They are absolute chaos, taken in the shape of man. Zero predictability. Their actions slave to their synapses. Caged, but uncaged. They are a terror and a plague a because a part of them still wishes to live. They are having children because at the very base of our animalistic nature we seek procreation. They are evolution's puppets, and through this they wreak havoc. We the unaffected feel pity for them. But we also fear them. For they are coming. They can not stop themselves. I have seen them cry as they kill, as they run children down in the streets. They are undetectable. You never know when one will simply decide to drive down to your town. They are everywhere. They are outside my home.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 199, "lang": "en"}

The lab had one of those nice 55 inch flat screens you see in offices and a remote which were usually non existent so they just watched it there. They turned on the TV, and to there amazement, every channel they turned to had the same newscaster, unfamiliar to them as if this was some secret news channel. It turned out to be a NASA press conference, and the marquee across the bottom of the screen said, \"Human remains found on Mars dating back approximately 2.9 Million years.\" Matt and Sarah looked at each other in shock and immediately went to the common area, everyone had their eyes glued to the big megatron screen. No one talking, no nothing, everyone in shock and awe. Matt, \"Holy shit what does this mean? er Sorry Mr. Fletcher, I got excited.\" Mr. Fletcher was there favorite professor at the Concord Aerospace and Space Exploration school. \"I don't know son, apparently we originated on Mars and there is evidence of widespread Catastrophic events that basically killed the planet, and forced humans to look to the skies. It was that or stay and burn.\" Sarah chimes in, \"Well that explains the existence of the water, and the behavior of the crystals we took samples of last month.

I have to go, I'll see you guys later.\" Mr. Fletcher and Matt waved goodbye as she went down the hall to call her Dad, he was one of the Aeronauts that was on the Mars mission and she had to know more. You see now they could send messages with no delay, and could call anyone basically anywhere in the milky way galaxy. Some messages could act as email and get as far as the Andromeda galaxy. \"Hey Dad, its me Sarah, what's going on how important is this discovery?\" The call cut in an out like a bad connection on a satellite phone. \"Hey Sara....

Held it up to her head and POW!\" Mr. Fletcher's head exploded like a Watermelon hit by an Elephant gun from a man dressed in black, with his face covered by some pantyhose material. \"Sarah it's me, you're brother, come with me now, Dad sent me for you.

{"text": "Strange things have always been happening to me. I can't exactly explain it. It's just a feeling, that something is following me. I twisted the doorknob open and let it fly open, creaking slightly. I felt the familiar nervousness and my hand immediately reached for the wall beside, crawling up frantically to find the light switch. When the light flickered to life, I let out my breath in relief. Yes, there was nothing. The carpet's where it should be. The ceiling..... I look up. Yes, the ceiling's pristine white and clean. There are no weird mounds on the couch..... it's safe. I flung my car keys on the table, taking a seat on a chair. Things didn't used to be like this. I guess it probably all started that day I got into a plane crash. I was the sole survivor, a living miracle, as the investigators called it. I don't remember much from the day. I know, however, that I met something I wasn't supposed to live seeing. I know I did. A shadow had appeared in front of me. With a closer look, I saw the faint outline of a young man, a very handsome young man. He was staring at me with curious eyes. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital, a 100 miles from home. That didn't end there. When I was finally discharged and ready to return home, I found a nasty surprise waiting for me when I opened my front door. A fresh bloody handprint was plastered on the wall. My eyes looked down, and I saw the corpse of a dead man. I instinctively screamed, bolting out from the house and huddling on the pavement in terror. I swore I saw the same shadow peer out meekly from the ajar door, disappearing the minute my fearful wild eyes laid upon it. I didn't have any incidents for about a year or so and I was beginning to think that it was just a hallucination. Then I came home one day to find my bedroom decorated with black roses, a floral perfume generously sprayed on the bed. Again, when I turned back, I saw the same shadow looking at me. When I walked towards it however, it disappeared. Next were chocolates. It was Valentine's Day then. I saw a pretty heart shaped box wrapped with gold ribbons with small pieces of chocolate inside. I had received a couple boxes of chocolate in the work office today, but none really intrigued me like this mysterious admirer of mine. I dropped the other boxes on the table, eager to open the heart shaped one. I nibbled the chocolate, half expecting the taste of blood, but there was nothing. It was just chocolate, only sweeter. I didn't see the shadow that day, even though I called for it, looking everywhere in my house for it. I did remember quite fondly, that when I returned to the dining room, the chocolates given by my coworkers were maliciously crushed and conveniently deposited into the trash. The chocolates in the heart shaped box were also rearranged to form a heart. I received little gifts time after time. A stuffed toy. A necklace that I stared at for almost an hour. A bracelet. A book. Sometimes I would find a plate of my favourite pasta waiting for me when I had a bad day. And today. The shadow didn't give me anything today. It is unusual. I rub my eyes to ease the fatigue. Opening my eyes, I was shocked to see a small velvet box in front of me. I looked around, and noticed the shadow hiding behind the couch. It had always been very timid, I noted with amusement. I opened it, smiling even before I knew what was inside. It was a ring. A simple diamond ring, the sparkling diamond encased in a band of gold. It was beautiful. I laughed, grinning as I put it on. \"I love you too.\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 203, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "Deep breath, I thought before putting my hand on the door handle. Sarah's house was right across the street, but the thought of holding my breath that long was already giving me a headache. I pressed my nose to the glass pane, leaving a small circle of fog where my mouth should be. You've done this plenty of times. Just don't get caught, I said to myself, counting the number of steps in my head. 36. 36 steps until I reach her door. It was plenty dark and there were no Suits on the street. Easy. Just like it always is. I craned my neck up to see past the window's frame, to look up at the night sky. There was always some sort of glare on the dome overhead. It was distracting. The metal beams that acted as scaffolding for the glass also did a great job of blocking out the moon. This was a blessing and a curse. You barely ever saw the moon anymore. When you did, it was like looking through a waffle iron. But it made the street even darker than it ought to be, so I didn't complain. Deep breath After a sharp inhale, I opened my door and stepped outside. I don't think I'll ever get used to the feeling in the air (or lack thereof) after curfew. It was an unsettling stillness that muffled sounds and made you feel alone, even if you really weren't. Tonight, I was most certainly not alone. By the time I made it to the hedges at the end of my driveway, I noticed a flash of light out of the corner of my eye, which sent me skidding to my ass behind the mailbox. I perched up on the balls of my feet and peeked through the leaves towards where the flsah had come from. Judging by the plastic yellow encasing of the individual maybe 1000 feet from my location, I didn't even have to think twice as to who or what it could be. Shit. Suits. Suits, or CEAs, were Curfew Enforcement Agents. They made sure that no one was sneaking out late at night after the government enforced curfew. You'd think, with the lack of oxygen, it would be completely unnecessary, but people still had access to O2 tanks these days. CEAs always wore these ugly ass yellow suits that acted as space suits, in a way. The oxygen tanks on their backs were a shiny chrome and a dead giveaway. Not very stealthy. But with semi-automatic rifles at their hips, they could afford lack of stealth. This observation took a total of.7 seconds, just enough time for my heart rate to increase, making my blood-oxygen level drop dramatically. I had to make a decision and fast. I rolled back on my heels and sat down on the grass. He hadn't seen me. His back was to me, which is why the glare from his O2 wank was so bright. I could either go back inside or risk crossing the street. At that exact moment, the Suit turned in my direction and began walking.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 206, "lang": "en"}

Now that I think about it, far too loud. I decided it was a good day to watch some television. \"Or not\" I said as I realized that I had to TV signal. I figured that since that was down, I wouldn't have Internet connection either, so that was ruled out. I heard footsteps upstairs, so I went to investigate, naturally. What I saw was terrifying. A mythical creature. Something from the story books I was told as a child. It ran around as if it was being hunted, or it was fleeing from somewhere. I went to get my tranqulizer gun I kept for intruders. I came back and opened fire. I finally hit it and went to go get it. I caught one. I was going to be rich.

{"text": "Jennifer is set to take off in about 10 minutes so I pull out my phone and call her. I can just imagine her sat in the departures lounge waiting for the announcement for her row to take their seats on the plane. It'll be crowded and she will have been alone for some hours now, I have to talk to her. \" Hey Jen, I can't wait for you to get back. I've missed you. \" \" Aww, Jason! I can't wait to be back. It has been tiring but I'm glad you got me out here, it was a wonderful idea. You wouldn't believe how much I have missed you. \" In the background of the call I hear a call for the passengers to start boarding. \" I have to go, you might have heard that but I need to get on. I'll talk to you later. I'll grab a taxi home and then I can give you your ' surprise '! Love you! Bye! \" \" I love you too! See you soon \" but the call has already ended. She will be at the airport in a couple of hours so I start getting ready to go. It's only a half an hour drive but I am going to get there early just to make sure that I don't miss her coming out from the gate. I've been planning for this day for months now. Weeks of shopping around to get the perfect ring for her, I decided to go for a silver ring with 3 large aquamarine crystals in it. It might sound plain, almost boring but I added one detail that I know she is going to love. On the inside of the ring, written in elvish script are the words \" Jennifer, you don't need a ring of power to rule my world, love Jason .\" She is a huge The Lord of the Rings fan, you see. Having bought the ring had I just needed to think of the right time. She is visiting her grandmother in Canada at the moment, possibly for the last time. At the age of 97 Claire had become frail and weak after living a full and exciting life, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she contracted influenza. Her health deteriorated rapidly and I knew that Jen had to go and see her one last time, she would never forgive herself if she didn't go. We scraped together the funds, borrowing from a few friends to accumulate enough to get her there and back. We didn't have to worry about accommodation, the hospital her grandmother is in has some accommodation for visitors that have travelled great distances to see loved ones, potentially for the last time. After a couple of hours I go out to my car and set off for the airport, I should get there with about 20 minutes spare before she gets out. I park my car in the visitor parking area and head into the arrivals area. Inside I can see the display showing when all the flights will arrive. Checking down the rows I spot Jennifers flight, CA465. It's been delayed. With a sigh I head over to a cafe so I can grab a hot drink and sit down for a bit. There isn't much point in standing around when there is at least 20 minutes left to wait. Sipping my coffee, I look around at the people with me in the cafe. There is an elderly couple sat in the corner. They aren't talking but they seem to be content to just sit there with each other. Thinking about the couple brings my thoughts back to Jen. I can imagine the look on her face when I get down on one knee and pull out the ring, It's going to be priceless. The rest of the people in the cafe aren't as interesting. There is a girl in her 20s working on a laptop and two guys with suitcases that probably just got off of a flight. With nothing better to do I start watching the television that is suspended above the tills. It's on a news channel that is currently discussing a recent story about a fire that broke out yesterday on an industrial estate, no one was injured but a few buildings were severely damaged. About 40 minutes have gone by now, I'm on my third coffee now and expecting Jen to be coming in at any moment. I get up and pick my coat up off of the back of the chair so I can go and stand in the arrivals area. As I'm leaving I hear \" BREAKING NEWS! \" from the television that is now behind me. Out of interest I turn back around and watch the story. The words \" missing flight \" make me uneasy but I'm not worried, Jen has probably landed and is picking up her bag now. I feel sorry for the poor souls on the missing plane though. It must be terrible to lose someone like that. The missing flight hasn't been identified yet by the news and after a couple of minutes I'm starting to get a bit worried. Jen still hasn't appeared and her flight doesn't seem to have come in yet. A couple of people nearby are looking worried and starting to panic. It's while I'm briefly looking at the other occupants of the arrivals area that I hear \" NO! OH GOD, PLEASE! NO! .\" I whirl round to look at the television where the flight number has been displayed. CA465. Jennifers flight. Missing. Everything goes quiet while I stare at the screen in shock. I have the ring in its box in my hand as I continue to stare. I'm still expecting Jennifer to walk through the gate and call my name; to have somehow arrived while the others did not. I feel hollow. Empty. Cold. A tear streaks down my face as reality sinks in. She's gone. Forever. Everything we had, everything we were going to have, erased. Destroyed. Missing. I don't feel the box fall out of my hand and hit the floor. By this point I don't care about it; about anything. My vision is going and I'm unsteady on my feet, but I don't try and grip anything. I let myself fall. My vision quickly fades to black as the ground approaches. \" Love you! Bye! \" Her last words to me, a hurried expression of her feelings that I was unable to reciprocate. \" I've missed you. \" My last words to her. I missed her. Now I always will. Probably not that great and I don't know what kind of word count your looking for: P This is around 1000:) I hope you like it and that there is enough story for you there: P", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 213, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "\"Are you sure you can't just give me a sample, sir? A potion, a ball, an escape rope, please, anything?\" \"I can't just give you anything for free. I'm sorry, that's company policy.\" I sighed and thanked the man for his time, walking outside for another gulp of too-fresh air. Every other shop I could get to said the same. The professor was out on a massive expedition and wouldn't be back for months, and there were no free ferry services out of the Hoenn region. If I couldn't get a Pokemon soon, I'd starve. There weren't any stable jobs for teenagers, save conscription, and I had heard some terrible rumors about back room life in the Centers and Shoppes. Mauville city hadn't even had an opening in the food court; the line of trainers looking for solid jobs was long. I needed a Pokemon, I needed to train it, and it needed to win. I couldn't surf to Mossdeep nor could I really navigate the tall grass. I'd already seen several innocents..... become permanently disabled. Training was a much harder life than I'd ever imagined. It was nigh impossible to find lodging or even a grocery store. People who didn't have meager homes were starving in the wilds, angrily storming up to any travelers, begging for alms or a money fight. Very few of the critters were happy, as it was with humans. Wilds would charge at me day and night if I wasn't in a city, and in the cities I was shooed away or I was running from thugs. One of the few hospitable places I had was a base built in a tree just south of Mauville. Though the area had been claimed by a group of thugs a long time ago, judging by some graffiti, the tree was largely unused by other people and Pokemon. I didn't have much, but over the few weeks I'd snagged a Treecko doll and a threadbare blanket, both stained with a mysterious amber substance. A secret base shop had broken a lamp and so had to relinquish these beauties to a trash can. I'd picked them up, watched them off in one of the infinite rivers, and simply swam back with it my own \"secret base.\" Most trainers used them for survival, any way. Trees were in low demand, as anyone with a Pokemon could get a much warmer, substantial cave instead. Food was a less fortunate commodity. It was impossible to catch and fry anything living, so I was limited to a diet of berries. At least I'm looking toned from all the exercise. The sun was already beginning to set. I yawned, curling up on the leafy floor with the blanket and the doll as a pillow. The blanket still smelled funny. I'd seen people worse off, I thought sleepily. Better to have something than nothing. Just as my eyes closed, I caught a flicker of movement. I stayed stock still, ears perked. Many seconds passed before I heard low breathing, high in pitch, and behind me to the left. A Pokemon? The \"door\" of my tree was nearer to me than it, but perhaps it had crawled in from the top branches. Carefully, I opened my eyes. An Aipom was hanging nervously from some branches- and trying to eat some of my berries. The poor creature was gaunt, with blackened, freshly singed fur. I almost felt sorry for it, but I needed a Pokemon, even just to barter, and I didn't recall having ever seen an Aipom in the area before. Maybe I could truck down one into thinking it was rare. The little critter nibbled tentatively at a ripe, pink Nanab berry. I casually crouched, turning so it wouldn't see me, and I held up the blanket. Step by excruciating step I approached. He (she?) didn't turn, but I noticed its ears perk and its handtail tense. I came closer. \"Hello.\" I said in a comforting voice. \"Take some berries. They're good for you.\" He didn't waste the opportunity, snatching most of my food supply. I didn't waste the chance either. As soon as his arms were sufficiently full of berries I lunged with the blanket extended. He jumped just as I did. I heard the sound of pulpy rinds hit the branches, some falling between the cracks. It got away with half my food. Shit.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 215, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Well, fuck. I've just been a complete jackass in the name of a YouTube video. Who knew that playing real-life Fruit Ninja with two swords isn't actually a good idea. Long story short, my friend threw a watermelon up too high and to the left, I went for the damn thing anyway, now I've fucked up my arm real bad. More importantly, I missed the watermelon. Prolly gon na need to go to the hospital for that one. \"Oh shit!\" my friend yelled, and I screamed to call 911. \"Tell them to haul a fucking ambulance over here for this shit right fucking now, I'm'ma prolly bleed to death from this shit, aw fuck!.\" My friend started rushing to find where he'd set his cellphone, I told him that I was gon na be in the bathroom inspecting what had happened. Dumb idea, but I was thinking fast, and fast doesn't equal smart, not every time at least. I ran like hell through our house to the bathroom, which is conveniently located at the exact opposite end of the house from the backyard doors. Sorry, mom and dad, looks like you've got a trail o' blood to clean up now. While I made my run, I could feel my hand shut down, so to speak; I couldn't move the thing anymore. I opened the door and immediately I grabbed a paper towel and started dabbing up the wound. Again, stupid move, but I didn't know what to do, and again, I was thinking fast. Anyway, as I continued to wipe my arm down with this thing. Thankfully I wouldn't be wasting too many towels or anything because the blood stopped. The blood stopped, I thought to myself. I was no medical doctor or anything, but I'm pretty sure that on no planet ever does \"brushing a large gash gently with a washcloth a couple of times\" stop the bloodflow. But yet, I ran my good hand down my arm, and sure enough, it came back dry - well, no wetter than it was before I ran my little \"experiment\" of sorts. My friend told me that his phone was dead, he couldn't call 911, could he please borrow mine. I told him there would be no need, it was just a false alarm. He told me I was insane but I insisted that 911 need not assist me. His response was a flat \"whatever,\" even though not five seconds earlier he was calling me a madman over the matter. Now then, I decided that it would be a good idea to figure out how false my false alarm really was, in case a call would end up having to be made. I turned my arm that I could see the injured side. When I looked at the gash in my arm, I expected to see muscles, sinew, and if I was really unlucky, bones. But there was none of that. Instead, what I saw was a rainbow of cords and wires of various thicknesses. In the center of the gash they were cut through. Copper was exposed on either end of the cut wires, and periodically a spark flew out. When this happened my bad hand twitched a bit. This doesn't make any sense. I'm a person. This is a dream. You're hallucinating from the blood loss. Slap yourself awake. Wait, that wouldn't work, you're freaking dying! I still hit myself just to make sure. Maybe the whole thing was a dream, from Fruit Ninja to now. Evidently it was no dream, I was still in the bathroom staring at an array of robotics inside my arm. I looked at all the metal and wiring, and noticed the small layer of \"skin\" stained red from the fake \"blood,\" convincing enough that a small scrape would pass completely unnoticed. This is some crazy good engineering. It must've taken ages. I realized that I was technically now talking about myself in the third person, and it felt like crazy talk. Suddenly I heard the massive front door to our house crashing down, then footsteps of what sounded to be multiple people. I practically smashed down the door to the bathroom door getting out of there to find out what the hell was going on. I went into the main room of the house. Outside the front door I could see a van. It had some company name on it or something, but I didn't have the time to make it out before one of the intruders pinned me to the floor. After this happened I felt myself falling asleep quickly. I heard some mumbling about what to do with me but I was falling asle- System shutdown prodedure completed.

How could my own DNA, recreated, be absolutely nothing like me? \"How is my wife?\" I said into the greasy black phone. The feedback of my own voice was almost enough to drive me insane. \"You mean my wife?\" The clone said indignantly. \"No, I don't, because you shouldn't even be there.

{"text": "You'd think being an intern at Marvel, house of the heroes, would be great. Spoiler alert: it sucks. I learned that about two weeks ago, barreling through the halls balancing a pyramid of doughnuts and a tray of coffee for a meeting that I couldn't even stay and watch. \" Top secret business \" my ass. The new director they're bringing in is a total prick-OK, he made a movie that made some old white people cry enough to give him an Oscar-but other than that, the dude is exactly what you'd expect the combination of Ivy league school, pretentious artist, and tons of money to make. Now, carrying a platter of pastries and fruit, I (yet again) hustle down the carpeted hallway, careful not to drop a single grape. When I get to the door, it's closed. Fuck. The meeting's already started. I have two choices-go in, overhear something, and risk my job, or wait by the door until they take a break in forty-five minutes. I check my pockets. I have my phone. Outside it is. I sink down into the corner of the walls next to the door, swiftly unsheathing my phone from my pocket. As I press my finger over the home button, the wall on my back thuds. Damn, it must be getting heated in there. Three more thuds. Someone's banging on the walls. Then, I hear the faint traces of a shouting match. \" He said every movie Marvel makes... \" \" ...it'll delay production by at least a month... \" \" CGI is already behind... \" \" ...wouldn't be right... \" \" ...fans would riot... \" \" ...too much work, it's not worth it... \" I know I shouldn't be listening in, but I can't help but wonder at what they're talking about. Suddenly, the door swings open, nearly smacking my shoulder. I see the director storm out, tie flying over his shoulder, papers in his wake. Behind, him, a round table of men in suits, gaping at the door, I pick up my platter, hustle in before the door shuts, and nudge it to the center of the table, being careful not to make eye contact with anyone at the table. \" Hey! \" Shit. They're talking to me. I look up, hesitantly, and make reluctant eye contact with my boss, who asks me, \" We need fan input. The director thinks Stan's cameo isn't worth a pushed-back release. Do you think we should delay production a bit to make sure Stan Lee's cameo is in there and done well? \" Holy fuck. They were talking about Stan's cameo.

He snapped it shut, grabbed the bag, and strode out the door. Not a bad one, God beckoned to the frail women next in line, does some nice pro-bono work. HE was starting to enjoy this little foray on the front lines. \"Pack of Marlboro Lights please. And ten on pump seven.\" The woman coughed. God sighed. \"You know these things'll kill you?\" \"Didn't ask for a sermon.\" God nodded and punched in the numbers. \"Don't know where boys like you get the gall.\" She muttered and snatched the receipt from his oiled fingers. \"In my day, the youth respected their elders.\" God leaned over the chipped counter and whispered, in as soothing a voice he could manage, \"You've got one year, six months, and six days. I recommend spending some time with Rosie and enjoying it.\" Her eyes widened. HE leaned back and beckoned towards the teenager tapping his foot behind her. \"Thank you, ma'am, come back and see us before then!\" The woman stumbled out the door. She also wan't too bad an example either. Just needs a bit of good old fear in her. God scanned the four-pack. \"I'm going to need to see some I.D.\" \"I.D?\" The teen's high-pitched voice didn't help his claim. \"I'm 22!\" He fumbled in his wallet while God only frowned. \"You were born on September 22, 1997.\" \"H-h-huh? How'd you know that? I mean..... I...\" The teen backed up and then dashed out the door. Humans sure are jumpy creatures. But this fear thing, it's kind of, well fun. God licked his lips and scanned the store for his next vict- er, customer. There were only two people left. A huge black man who was eyeing him nervously over the Slim Jim rack, and a middle-aged taxi driver who had just come in for her third coffee refill. He was hoping for the man, but the taxi driver shuffled towards the counter first. \"How's business?\" God asked while the woman counted out coins. \"Same shit, different day.\" God chuckled. \"You have no idea.\" HE liked this woman. \"I'm going to do you a favor. Don't pick up the man at 22nd and East Broadway tomorrow.\" Her left eyebrow went up as she pushed the quarters towards him. \"Oh yea, what's he done to you?\" HE shrugged. \"Man's on bail with two convicted armed robberies.

God bless you.\" God felt a tingling in his chest. \"Thanks ma'am. Have a good one, and glad I'll see you again soon.\" She chuckled and sashayed back to her car. God knew she didn't really believe him, but she wasn't going to pick up the guy either way. The door chime rang twice as the burly black man rushed out and a teacher walked in. \"Hey bub. I need twenty on pump six.\" God took the twenty. \"Hey, don't you want your receipt?\" \"Naw man, save the planet.\" The young teacher was already heading back towards the door. Not done with you yet. \"Save your own life and don't drive drunk tonight.\" The teacher stopped with his hand on the door. \"What is this an advice column?\" \"You're going to go to your sister's, Macy McDowell's, farewell party tonight.

{"text": "Eight years ago I was visiting a day spa on holiday, in the mountains when a massive earthquake destroyed everything. Or at least I assume that it did there's no way for me to tell, really. At the moment of the earthquake, I was getting myself a towel from an exceptionally large closet. I've been trapped in here ever since. Something's blocking the door, I don't know what. I've stopped thinking about it. I've made the best of it, though. There's definitely enough room in the closet to make a life in, and enough towels to make it with. My towel bed is comfortable and spacious, my towel couch is well-stuffed and folds out if I have guests. There's even a towel lamp, which I use to read towel books in the evening. The lamp's shade is a particularly thin hand-towel, kind of like the napkins they give you at fancier restaurants, and for kindling I use old rags that have served their purpose. I've even got art there's a towel by Macy's that I'm particularly fond of, framed on the wall. It's a luxuriant blue, with the kind of texture that dazzles if you look at it too long, and often I do. I was thinking of getting another one, but I don't want the wall to look too cluttered. There's a fine aesthetic balance, there. I even started my own family Junior was just a washcloth only a few years ago, and already he's the kind of hand towel that I always believed he would be. His mother and I are so very proud. It's a blissful scene in the morning I'm reading the paper when he comes down around eight, just in time for school. My wife is in the kitchen, making breakfast the hearty smell of towels cooking hits me all at once, and I'm content. I won't lie to you, though even though I've just described to you this perfect idyll of domestic life, sometimes I wonder what happened to the rest of the world. That's why I'm not worried right now, even though something is making noises against the door I mentioned. I'm perfectly calm. I have towels wrapped tightly around me, and I feel safe. The door finally opens. A man walks in. He looks around, then turns to shout to someone, \"Hey, I found all the towels!\" Then he turns back, and sees me. At first he is only confused, but I give him a sincere smile and it seems to reassure him. He says to me, \"We've been looking for towels for a very long time we knew they were around here somewhere, we just didn't know where.\" He inspects me carefully. I'm wearing my towel suit, as I was just about to go to work, so I don't mind the intense sartorial scrutiny. But I don't say anything. \"How long have you been in here?\" \"Eight years,\" I finally say. For a moment, he contemplates in silence what such a long time must mean. Its weight is surely felt. Then he says, \"Listen, there's a spa out there, and a bunch of teams from the FIFA Women's World Cup just showed up. They're all just running around naked, since we ran out of towels. I'm not telling you that you have to, but if you could grab a handful of towels and bring them out, it would be really helpful.\" I look back at my life my furniture, my kid, my wife.

{"text": "Chapter One \"You only get to make this choice once,\" He said. \"Existence is an infinite curve, but the chance to step through one of these two doors only comes around once. The gate of Death, of which you have now passed, affords you this chance. The first door is paradise, the promised land. A place of eternal happiness where you may find peace. The second, knowledge. Consider it a job, of sorts, employment in my Kingdom.\" \"There are three,\" I said, and fought a nervous grin. Surely you know that..... \"Your pardon?\" He said. \"There are three doors.\" I pointed to each door in turn, the first on a wooden pedestal, the second on stone, and the third door off to the side on a dais of obsidian crystal. Something about the third door seemed menacing. \"Uno, dos, tres, Padre.\" As strands of soft white cloud whipped past us, under a sky burning with trillions of stars and bands of interstellar dust, God blinked. He stood resplendent and noble in flowing white robes. His beard tucked into the waist of a simple brown belt, and His eyes were two chips of hard, yet kind, blue diamond. I knew without knowing that how I saw Him was just how my mind interpreted His being. I imagined the countless billions who had stood before me had seen countless variations of Him. He looked from me to the third door and his eyes grew less than kind. A glint of something that surely couldn't have been fear flashed across His face. \"None see that door,\" He said. \"None dare.\" \"Where does it lead?\" I asked, always the curious one. I'd died young, barely thirty, and the fact that there was any sort of afterlife at all had come as something of a shock. \"I...\" He hesitated. God hesitated. \"I \"You don't know.\" I took a step back and crossed my hands behind my back. A long moment passed in that timeless place, under the burning heavens, and I stood politely. What else could I do? \"You picture me as the Creator,\" He said finally, choosing his words with great care. \"You assume I am boundless, untethered to the structure of reality within creation. And in a great sense I am. However..... however, John,\" And hearing my name uttered from the mouth of God is perhaps the most surreal thing that's ever happened to me, \"however. These doors were here before Me. They are part of My bargain. To pull the universe from the void requires a certain sort of contract. An agreement with agents of something I will simply call Nameless. Something that exists in spite of existence, outside of the universe. An anti-God, to put it rather crudely.\" He laughed, but there was no mirth in it. A tear rolled down His cheek and melted into His beard. \"Within the rules of the universe,\" he continued, \"I am bound more tightly than any mortal. Something as vast and as powerful as creation requires elegance. \" He stressed the word, as if it pained Him. \"You meet Me here, all of you sentient beings from across the cosmos, you meet Me here upon your deaths, because here before these doors is the only place in all of Creation where we can meet. Do you understand?\" \"No,\" I said honestly. \"But then I'm not meant to, am I?\" He shook his head and smiled grimly. \"You're a sharp one, John. Perceptive. It's what got you killed, you know.\" I stared down at the rose blossom of crimson that stained my shirt, over my heart. The bullet had killed me instantly, fired from the shadows on a rainy night in London. I'd been walking with Mary Grace, my fiancee, toward Trafalgar Square. I'd really wanted a drink. I remember that, the thirst, more than the look on her face as my past caught up with me at the muzzle velocity of about a thousand feet per second. \"So what's through the third door?\" I asked Him. \"Door one is happiness, door two is knowledge, door three is..... well, either a goat or a car, I'm guessing.\" \"Nameless,\" He said, and placed a hand on my shoulder. I felt a warmth, a light, a surety that all would be well and that God had a plan even if He didn't know it Himself. \"And so, Johnathon Hale, which door do you choose?\" I cracked my knuckles and offered Him a quick salute. \"Eternal happiness sounds boring, infinite knowledge..... I guess that means seeing the backstage of your show. Kind of ruins the magic, don't you think? Unless its turtles all the way down? Is it turtles?\" His expression cracked and shoulders slumped. \"The third door then. I'd hoped that creation would end before I had to open this door.\" He sighed and stood up tall. \"Very well then, Hale.\" Together we stepped onto the crystal dais and the Old Man who tended tirelessly to the lighthouse grasped an ornate iron handle, caked in milleniums of dust. The dark door shone with emerald green light as he ever so effortlessly turned the handle. A draft of warm air struck me in the face, carrying the heady scent of vanilla and something like freshly mown grass. I could taste old leather, hear the creak of warped floorboards. \"What do you see?\" He asked. \"I...\" I chuckled. \"Is this a joke? What do you see?\" \"Nothing,\" He said. \"I see nothing but darkness.\" Beams of sunlight from beyond the door warmed my face and I stared at Him intently before turning back to the door. \"That's not what I see,\" I said, and stepped across the threshold. The door swept closed behind me, and I stood alone in a room stacked high with books before a tremendous window alcove.

{"text": "[ ] (dropcap) Superbowl LXIV I can feel his eyes on me. He has been the talk of the season. Leo Rex, they call him, the king of the strongest Lions side in history. There's another name for him though, a name that I find much more worrying. It's 14 minutes into the fourth quarter, and counting. Second down and five. The Lions lead us by four points. We are 64 yard, 2 feet, and 9 inches from the endzone. There is less than a minute to win this game, and we are not even in the Lions half. He's ended the career of two other quarterbacks. The first was a sickening tackle in his rookie year, on an aging quarterback who made a bad decision to run the ball. Pop went the ACL, and just like that one more Heisman winner bites the dust. He nearly got through the defense around me three plays ago. My line is getting tired. I know he can sense it, and he knows I know he can. Earlier this year, he ripped through the defense protecting another quarterback. 250 pounds of muscle and bone, straight into the torso of James Hellart, two time Superbowl winner. Paralyzed from the waist down. They suspended him for two games, but he hadn't broken any rules. He bumped into me after the first play, three hours ago. \" I'm gon na fuck you up, Hellart, \" he said. \" I'm gon na get the set. \" A six and a half foot, 220 pound man doesn't usually think of himself as prey, but the back of my neck is prickling. I visited James in hospital the night after the game that broke his spine. \" Watch out for him, Tony, \" my brother said. \" He's a killer. \" We're running the Harlem harlot this play. We've used it twice this season. It's worked both times. But unfortunately, I am the harlot, and this field is no place for a lady of any kind. He sacked a quarterback in each of his first four games this season. The \" Quarterback Killer ,\" the media started to call him. Then he took on my brother and they stopped. It was too close to the truth. Snap. The ball pops out of the line, straight into my hands. I take two steps back. On my right, a wide receiver has made it through the defense, and is haring up the field. The other is held down. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see him, fighting to get through the line holding him back. 1 second down. I fall back a few more steps, out of the pocket and exposed. This play calls for bait. The harlot is flashing her goods. Can they resist me? 2 seconds down. A gap opens up as a defensive linebacker and a tackle break out towards me. The wide receiver is twenty yards down the field, but he is no longer open. And then my halfback is through the gap and free and away. 3 seconds down. My arm snaps forwards and the ball is gone. The linebacker and the tackle are still five yards away and I see the shock suddenly register in their eyes. Good, I think, they've realised their mistake. They start to change direction to miss me. 4 seco- Something hits me on the right, straight into my hips. Unbalanced from the throw, I crumple to the ground like a rag doll whipped around in the maw of a lion.

{"text": "The Slaughtered Calf had traditionally been the drinking establishment of choice of which ever nation occupied the border town of Graffe. Originally, a wooden sign of a calf painted gold had adorned the front of the building. During one of the many shifts of national control over the city, the calf lost its head. The Gilt Calf turned into the Slaughtered Calf. This suited the soldiers just fine. Over time, multiple soldiers deep in their cups found themselves dispatched by men from the other nation who took the city in the night. A visitor to Graffe could always tell which nation held it by the regimental banner hanging outside the door. On the armistice day, both the blue banner of the Empire and the gold banner of the Republic fluttered in the midsummer breeze. Garl sat at the bar, seven tankards in. Three of his squad mates threw dice at a nearby table.They luxuriated in their first chance to visit the Slaughtered Calf in months. Garl waited patiently for the barkeep to haul up a fresh cask of Ogre Spit. His squad's laughter died as the door to the bar banged open flooding the room with afternoon light. The barkeep, pony keg securely ensconced in his arms, entered the room and immediately dropped the precious liquid on the floor. The crack of wood and sloshing of liquid filled the silence that accompanied the new arrivals. The barkeep cursed. Garl spared a glance over his shoulder to see who had delayed the enjoyment of his favorite beverage. A squad of blue cloaks stood glowering at the occupants of the room. A tall man with a shaved head and a puckered scar running from his temple to just past his ear pushed past his comrades to enter. Garl whistled low and to himself with appreciation. The thorn in the side of the 6th Company of the Grand Republic had just walked through the door. Garl wanted to kill Corin more than he wanted to taste Ogre Spit again. He savored the satisfaction of his daydream before the reality of the inevitably resultant court marshal quashed his thoughts. \"A round of your finest ale for my men, Horace. And one for our new, peaceful neighbors from the east. And a flagon of Ogre Spit for myself.\" Corin called out as he made his way to the bar, taking a seat two away from Garl. The rest of the blue cloaks shuffled in and set up around the dart board, well apart from Garl's friends. Horace muttered something indistinct to himself in the surliest manner before barking out, \"Don't break anything!\" He then called into the kitchen, \"Martha, six ales. I got to get another cask of Ogre Spit.\" The barkeep then disappeared down into the cellar. Before tensions rose up between the dice players and the dart throwers, the barkeep's wife came out with six tankards with too much foam on the head and hastily served them to the men before returning to the recesses of the kitchen. Garl grunted with displeasure and began spinning an Imperial Talent on the bar. \"Queer. Isn't it.\" Corin spoke to him. Garl grunted without conviction. Corin sidled over to the seat next to him. \"It's Garl, not Kweer.\" Garl said. He slapped the coin down revealing the face of the Empress. He spun it again and it wobbled until it landed on the face of the Emperor. Corin, not dissuaded by Garl's less than plesant demeanor, smiled and pulled out one of the blue paper notes of the Republic. \"I know you Garl. Those soldiers at the darts have cursed your name more often than not. I just mean it's strange. This peace.\" The imperial held the paper note in between his hands. It bore the marks of multiple transactions. The corners appeared frayed and the ink indicating it as a single note rubbed off to the point of near illegibility. Garl grunted again. Corin continued, \"I mean, if this were yesterday, we'd all be trying to kill each other. But here we are, we've each got money that's really only valuable in this town and the other's nation. We've both got reputations and \"And we're both waiting for our fuckin' Ogre Spit,\" Garl interrupted. As if summoned, the barkeep thumped back into the room, another keg of the liquor in his possession. His eyebrows raised in surprise that no one had killed anyone else. Settling the keg behind the bar, he tapped it and filled two tankards with a more than generous proportion of the viscous fluid before placing them in front of Garl and Corin. Both men took a deep draught of the strong alcohol. They exchanged looks out of the corner of their eyes. Garl began to gulp his down in larger swallows. Corin followed suit. Both Garl and Corin slammed their empty mugs down on the bar top and gasped for air at the same time. Their men looked up from their respective pursuits; one or two of them placed a hand on their weapons. Any concern of a struggle vanished at once when both of the haggard veterans began to laugh. \"Aye, it's queer, Corin, drinking with a man you called enemy, but I'll be thrice-damned if I don't respect a man who can down Ogre Spit like that,\" Garl said. A grin split his face and he offered his hand out to the opposing sergeant. A small smirk played at the corner of Corin's mouth and reached out. The men shook hands, and Garl turned back to the barkeep, \"Horace, another Ogre Spit for me and me friend here!\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 229, "lang": "en"}
{"text": "Ian, looked up as his daughter poked her head through the door. \"Father, your 12 o'clock is here?\" \"Send him in,\" he sighed. It was such a waste of his time. Everyday for the past, what? Half a century already? the boy had come to beg for mercy. The boy slinked into the room, bashful. He always seemed to be trying to shrink himself. To atone for his father. Frankly, it gave Ian migraines. The boy spoke up: \"I AM, father of the heavenly hosts, the one Ian cut him off. \"Alright Lucifer. We've been over this. Just call me Ian.\" What had Ian been thinking? 10 centuries and people were still calling him that pretentious name. It took a full five minutes to even say! He'd been so immature in 2nd century b.c. -the year he created the humans. He'd gone by God for awhile, but then every Odin, Zeus and Khrishna started using the name. Anyway, the boy. Ian refocused in time to catch him halfway through his spiel. \"You know how Luke can be. He'll never set up the meeting. If you could just meet him halfway- return to Earth maybe? He'd come around. He'd have to!\" Ian had to hand it to him. The boy was genuinely pleading for his father's soul. But frankly, there was nothing he could do. Speaking of Frank, he wondered which of the angels was in charge of lunch today. He'd better wrap this up. \"Lucifer, I'm truely sorry. There's nothing I can do. The humans won't let us back on Earth. They don't want the Apocalypse to begin.\" Another area where he'd been a little too pretentious. Now the humana wouldn't speak to him at all for fear he'd return. Lucifer's shoulders slumped. He mumbled \"Thanks for your time. God, father of \"You're welcome- think nothing of it.\" Ian wasn't really. He was thinking of lunch, as Lucifer slinked back out, grabbing a muffin from the care basket the angels left. But perhaps he'd better let Luke no what his son was up to. It was a conversation he'd rather avoid. Luke always thought Ian was judging his parenting. Sanctidaddy, he called him. Ian had tried sending him the avocado essay, but Luke wouldn't bite. Ian, picked up his phone. He dialled 666. Luke picked up almost immediately, huffing \"Who dares interupt the feast of souls?\" Luke was as pretentious as ever. \"Luke, it's dad. Look, I don't want to cause the boy any trouble, but you should know Luke cut him off. Ian had tried to teach him not to interrupt, but monkey see, monkey do. \"Just because Jesus is so \"perfect,\" doesn't mean you get the right to judge MY SON. I'm so sick of your shit, dad. I'll discipline him how I see fit! You were just as harsh on me, when did you become soft, eh' old God?\" Then he hung up. Ian sighed. How was it Lucifer Sr didn't see? He knew he'd made mistakes. He knew he'd messed up with his Luke. Jesus was never meant to be a replacement. They were all his children. He hung his head in shame. He'd lost his appetite. He spent his lunch as he usually did- locked in his office. And he wept.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 230, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "\"Yay for the year 2019,\" I said to myself as my wrist mounted time transporter placed me back in time safely. It needed to be done. After the \"paper war,\" records of this era are sadly lacking and it was my job as historian to go back and write the historical record anew. \"To the library,\" I muttered to myself. I could make use of my training in the electric internet that was so popular back then. It seemed to go so well at first. I said hello to the librarian using the local vernacular, found an internet computer that looked similar to the one I had in training, and started the google searching. But my searches turned up no sensible results. \"2016 sport results\" found nothing I could use, and it was the same for \"2016 election result,\" \"2016 deaths,\" and \"2016 world news.\" I was starting to get concerned, but I knew a fancy google trick - I could filter the results by date. \"2016\" using a date range of january 2017 to january 2018. That would do the job, I was sure, but it just returned the cryptic result of Your search - 2016 - did not match any documents. I must admit that I was starting to get a bit concerned.

We got pressured in to buying some tacky necklace for about fifteen times the asking price. I was so ashamed that I lost face in front of her like that. It was emasculating. \"Mate, are you for real? Those carrots have two days left, tops. This is a good radio.\" Actually, it was a pretty crappy radio. A charity started giving them out just after the war started so we could hear news about the front line, so most people had one at some point. However the build quality was terrible and most of them stopped working in the damp. \"I've got two already - can't sell them. You got anything else?\" I hated this part. I'd lost, and he knew it. Food was getting valuable, especially fresh food like that. I looked again at the carrots. Last year I would have tossed these mangy things back in to the organic, fair trade, simply delicious basket and not thought anything of it. Did you know that baby carrots were just those mangy ones cut down? I didn't. \"No, that's it.\" I tried to look as pathetic as possible. It was a long shot, even if he doesn't sell them he could eat them himself. We both knew there wasn't any reason for charity. \"Sorry, mate. Can't help you,\" he looked past me, \"Alright, mate? Any carrots for you? What you got?\" Fuck sake. I turned away and started back since it was late in the afternoon. Bad haul today. I left with some screwdrivers and a lump hammer, and now I'm coming back with a radio and a pair of gloves. That girl really laid it on with the radio. Good price, good price! Fuck off. Can't eat a fucking radio. What was I thinking? Still, it's something. Mainly I've just been bored. A little music on the windy-up radio could be a pleasant change of pace. The streets in this part of town, which used to be an inner city slum, haven't really changed. A little more dirty, a little more rubble, but aside from that not too different. Most people here weren't smart enough to leave, or just straight didn't have the money. It's probably the most inhabited part of town. I turned down the alley that took me towards home, and the streets started to fill with more debris. A wall missing here, a half destroyed car there, and a badly shot up checkpoint. Most of the damage to it was done after the soldiers left by the rebels. I never understood what was so satisfying about shooting it up. They did it sporadically for days. There's something about the war that turned everything grey and brown. The sky was the colour of old tea stains on the pot, the walls a uniform state of drab. I wandered in to the courtyard of my newest home, a small, two storey, derelict workshop building. It was a little safer here as the fighting wasn't in the immediate area, and there wasn't much left to bomb. Some other people had taken a cursory look at the place, but the ground floor is full of water. The first floor wasn't too bad but from the outside it looked pretty beat up, even if the windows were still mostly there and the roof was intact. I walked up the metal fire escape and blew in to my hands. Oh yeah, I have gloves. Maybe not such a waste after all. And there was a little rice left. It had rained a lot recently so I had some water. Things weren't so bad. I jiggled the door unstuck and screeched it shut behind me. I lit a small fire. I had a little metal barrel I used to burn wood in, although the wood was getting low. I had a lot of books to burn, if I needed to. Nobody really cares for books, they were valueless commodity to most people. I thought they had a lot of uses. I took them all the time. I wasn't so stupid to check that the radio worked before I traded for it, so I gave it a little wind to see what I could pick up. Man, she was pretty though. East European, or something. Brunette, green eyes, long hair - regular foreign hottie. A year ago I probably would have just given her the screwdrivers. Huh, isn't it weird that a year ago I would have thought she was lucky to be here? I started thinking about those places. I went to Poland once, to watch the football.

But, once we'd found ourselves on the precipice, we changed. We pulled back from our own destruction. Our society learned to use less and use smarter. We took the amazing progress we'd made chasing better... toys... and put that knowledge to work fixing the deep wounds we'd cut into our world. The all-encompassing smog was throttled into submission. The skies cleared and people came out to see the stars for the first time in half a century. The forests began to grow, renewed. Not just those ridiculously simplistic tree farms, but real, honest to God forests. The lakes and streams were cleansed. No longer were they filled with putrid slime. They were filled with fish and life and water so pure you could drink from any river in the world. Even the oceans were coaxed back to life from the stagnant, salty pools they'd become. Decades of work by the brightest minds for a generation were poured into those depths, which even now are still blossoming with life. I remember the first time I saw wide open grass fields. I was ten and I'd never seen anything like it before. The stars had been a wonder, but those green fields had been tangible. Something I could grab with my hands and pull up by the root from that dark, rich, life giving soil. I'd known right then that we were truly building an Eden for ourselves, a paradise for all to share. I'm standing in that same field now. It's as barren and dead as it was in the dark times. One hundred years of our work, one hundred years of the greatest struggle and triumph humanity had ever engaged in, destroyed in five. They came without warning. They did not negotiate. They didn't even attempt communication of any kind as far as I'm aware. They just fell from the sky, their thousand kilometer forms falling across mountain and valley and city alike. Their great maws opened wide as they began to devour the land, the very mass of the Earth. They're called Von Neumann machines and they are unsympathetic, unthinking tools let loose on the galaxy by creators who are equally so. As I stand here, on this vast plain, awaiting the launch of our arks, I can't help but feel a great irony. For us to have existed here for so long unmolested, to have behaved exactly as these machines almost to the point of our own destruction, and then to have miraculously changed our nature only to crushed under the ultimate expression of our greatest vice, is just... too cruel to be coincidence.

I sat on the fluffy white sofa while the angels popped in once in a while to check in on me. \"Will one of you stupid winged asses tell me what's going on?!\" I yelled into the room and felt startled when the angels all appeared inside the room with looks that ranged from hosility to curiousity. A tall man with wings of pure white stepped forward with a frown on his face. I stood up but my petite size can never match his height. \"You are dead and for some odd reason, you got admitted into Heaven.\" He told me gruffly. I rolled my eyes at him and placed a hand on my waist. \"Duh Captain Obvious. I already know I'm dead and in Heaven.\" I ignored the look of puzzlement he gave me and continued. \"I thought that I'm supposed to be in Hell?\" The tall angel looked around and that's when I noticed that we're not in the same room with all the angels anymore. Instead, we're in a cozy bedroom that smelled familiar even though I can't place the scent. \"It was an error on my part. It was supposed to be your friend Lucien but the plans have changed.\" He said while pouring a cup of coffee. I didn't even notice him get the cup. It just appeared there. I bit my lip and glared at his wings. \"So your stupidity caused me to end up in Heaven instead of the original Hell as was agreed upon in my deal with Lucifer? And where the hell is Lucien?\" I asked coldly and I noticed him freeze for a second before slowly lowering the coffee on the table. He turned his head to look at me with disappointment. \"You were the perfect vassal. I do not understand why you would sell your soul to my brother. You had everything a human would ever ask for. As for your friend, he is safely healing in the hospital after the accident.\" I closed my eyes and felt anger rising inside my heart. The angel has been nothing but nice to me but I still felt annoyed at him for interfering. \"So I'm here as a prisoner.\" I stated blandly while taking a deep breath. \"Yes.\" I heard him answer me with the same tone. \"You are to be held here until your contract with my brother has been broken.\" I opened my eyes to glare at him but I am alone inside the room. I let out a sigh and sat down at the bed with the velvet sheets. I could've ended it all. I could've set my soulmate's soul free if the angels didn't interfere. The mission would've been done if they didn't make that deliberate'mistake'. Lucifer would never let go of my soul that easily as he told me back when we struck the deal. Now, I'm stuck here as a prisoner in Heaven with no way to contact anybody! I grabbed the velvety pillow and crushed it to my face before screaming my lungs out.", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 238, "lang": "en"}

{"text": "我叹了一口气。“Boudreaux先生，这既不是你滑稽动作的时间，也不是你滑稽行为的地点。Ravenclaw得了10分，”我斥责道，低头看着转校生。“教授，这不公平！亨利女士把魔杖掉了，我只是想帮她！”男孩用浓重的路易斯安那口音抗议，愤怒之情溢于言表。坐在他右边的那个十一岁的金发碧眼的年轻人一说出她的名字就脸红了。我举起眼镜，严厉地凝视着他。自从一位访问伦敦的美国巫师捕捉到了最新的大黑巫师（一位前拉文克劳巫师，在勃艮第屠杀了一个沉睡的村庄时，他对创造性六角体的欣赏有点失控）以来，人们一直在努力从殖民地吸引更多的交换生。大多数都是非常优秀的学生。从塞勒姆学院转学的学生以其优雅和决斗技巧而闻名。底特律Warlock学院不那么受人尊敬，但他们的学生与其他人相处得很好。新奥尔良魔法学院的学生们却臭名昭著。这些转会是早熟的、雄心勃勃的，而且有点残忍。他们从小就接受过其他地方没有练习过的魔法训练。这些嗜好包括血腥魔法、仪式性的祭祀魔法和伏都教。这些魔法带有强烈的负面含义，比如黑暗，或者至少在霍格沃茨更文明的巫师中令人反感，但却吸引了更多人的想象力。。。。。道德沦丧。南部殖民地独特的文化为这些年轻的巫师和女巫带来了更独特的成长过程。区分这些巫师中的一个和其他巫师最简单的方法是用他们通常随身携带的大刀来帮助他们准备祭品或进行仪式性的巫毒。一把刀，很像艾伦·布德雷奥正在抚摸的那把刀，他的眼睛里闪烁着黑暗的光芒。“Boudreaux，我建议你把刀留在鞘里。你已经十岁了。我是世界上最负盛名的巫师学校的决斗教练。我可以在几秒钟内把你骨头上的皮融化，”我威胁道，试图表现出懒散自信，而不是傲慢傲慢的击球。只要我把紧张的痛苦藏在肚子里，傲慢就可以了。Boudreaux真的让我毛骨悚然。NOAWWAM的其他孩子对他敬而远之。今年早些时候，一名斯莱特林试图将他全身捆绑（这是从第二年和第三年到第一年最喜欢的时间），年轻的斯莱特林最终在医务室呆了几个月。Boudreaux的破坏性和攻击性咒语对一个仍在努力发射不同颜色火花的学生来说太高了。通常情况下，我会全力支持他为霍格沃茨决斗（我们的青少年队去年在国际比赛中输给了达姆斯特朗队），但这个孩子真的让我毛骨悚然。他眯着眼睛看着我。他张开嘴想说话，亨利女士，一个可爱的乌鸦爪，魔杖移动不准确，把手放在他的手臂上，轻轻地捏了捏。他瞥了她一眼，放松了下来，双肩垂下，眉头展开。我从里面松了一口气，转身看着黑板上的粉笔为我写字。“Expelliarmus，”我慢慢地说，每个音节都在发音。“这是一个简单的解除武装的咒语，但它帮助了许多陷入困境的巫师。无魔杖巫师的力量没有出口。很少有巫师能在没有魔杖的情况下施展魔法，所以这是许多决斗者、极光和法师剧目中的第一个咒语。”我转向课堂，听到一个年轻的声音喊着咒语。我的魔杖松散地握在手里，飞了起来。粉笔掉到地上折断了。Boudreaux手里拿着我的魔杖，笑了。他的眼睛是棕色的，看起来是黑色的，向我一闪而过。班上有些人笑了，有些人看起来很担心，担心即将发生的事情。我不知道他们是关心我还是关心他们的同学。“Boudreaux，”我用我能召集到的最冷静的语气说，“这是非常不合适的。”我私下里对他在听了一次咒语后能够施展咒语感到惊讶，而且没有任何关于最佳魔杖图案的注释来集中注意力。“我只是在练习，雷德曼教授，”男孩回答，“G”一如既往地没有出现在他随意的讲话风格中。有人会认为这会影响他的拼写，但这个孩子是个神童。“好吧，你显然掌握了窍门，”我回答，“现在把魔杖递给我。”我伸出手来。他也伸出了手，但就在我碰魔杖的时候，他把魔杖掉了下来。魔杖咔嗒一声掉在地板上。十英寸，狮头犀羽毛核心。我感到鲜血直流。小混蛋慢慢地笑了笑，露出了他的小牙齿。当我慢慢弯下腰拿起魔杖时，全班同学都笑了。“哦，哎呀，对不起，教授，”他用天真无邪的大眼睛和他对善良本性的最佳射击表达了歉意。“我猜你的速度没有我想象的那么快，尤其是对于这样一个著名的决斗者。”他的评论激怒了我。七年前，我在一次锦标赛中被新的世界冠军决斗者击败后，被邀请到霍格沃茨担任我的职位。新的冠军，一个来自马胡托科罗的速度极快的女巫，在我施出保护符之前，偷偷地对我施了一个身体束缚的咒语，这让我大吃一惊。输掉一场比赛最丢脸的莫过于丢脸了。“我可能没有年轻时那么快了，但我仍然是世界上最顶尖的决斗者之一。”骄傲的声音渗入我的声音。“听说过伏都教吗，教授？”Boudreaux漫不经心地问道。“当然。”我慢慢地点点头，尽管我自己也很感兴趣。“嗯，我爸爸总是告诉我，关于巫毒，最重要的是要记住准备。看，魔法是在你真正用它做任何事情之前就完成的。”他抿着嘴唇，好像在努力记住。“你必须收集一些DNA，做一个娃娃，表演咒语。”他的声音太低了，我不得不靠进去听他说话。背景似乎很远，我们的眼睛紧紧地合在一起。“在那之后，你什么时候做也没关系。我今天可以帮你梳一些头发，在你八十岁生日那天打断你的背。我可以在千里之外割断你的喉咙。”我无法控制鸡皮疙瘩顺着手臂蔓延。孩子的声音低沉得可怕，他的自信也令人害怕。“好吧，谢谢你的课，但你今天浪费的课已经够多了，”我自信地说，我没有感觉到。“拉文克劳给了他200分。”他收回了一句话，在亨利女士的催促下坐了下来。在剩下的课上，他懒散地坐在椅子上，双臂交叉。我没有抱它们太久。我的背上全是汗，我想去洗洗。下课后，他向我走来。我收拾行李时抬头看了他一眼。“是的，Boudreaux？”我专业地问道。“我只是想为我今天的行为道歉，教授，”这个小男孩真诚地说，但他的眼睛却无法表达。“很好。我知道我们的学校结构与美国不同，”我表示。Boudreaux笑了。他转身想走开，但匆匆忙忙地把我桌上的镇纸碰掉了。我们都弯下腰去捡，头撞了一下。当我们开始远离对方时，他的手伸进了我的头发，他的头撞到了我的头上。“你还好吗，教授？”他问道，听起来像是真正的担心，“我不是故意不伤害你的。”“好吧，Boudreaux，在路上。”我拿起包走出房间，决心洗个澡，喝几杯。我最终在浮士德的一家潜水酒吧遇到了其他几位教授，这家酒吧位于霍格莫德人迹罕至的地方。在喝了超过我应得份额的各种啤酒后，我跌跌撞撞地回家了。我摘下帽子，耸耸肩，脱下长袍。我倒在床上，决定早上用咒语刷牙。疼痛我尖叫起来。我的胃灼热的疼痛。我的手飞到胃里找伤口，但什么也没找到。我的心跳加速，因为疼痛并没有减轻，而是建立在自己身上。每一个动作都让我爆发出新的痛苦。当同样的感觉在我的肩膀上开始时，我尖叫起来。在拉文克劳的女生宿舍里，一个年轻的金发女孩弯下腰，一只手拿着针，另一只手抱着一个小娃娃。一个声音从她身后传来：“干得好，克拉拉。现在把针插在它的心里。”年轻女孩照做了。当女孩转过身来看着Boudreaux时，他的脸上露出了笑容。她放下娃娃，现在有一根针扎进了心，两人手挽手。Boudreaux看着他那只空闲的手上的一根头发。又矮又黑。“你从来都不喜欢草药学，是吗，克拉拉？”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 254, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "有一片土地是全世界最喜欢的。它在中心，更接近生命的起源。这是最古老的土地，一切都是从这里开始的。在北方，沙漠绵延辽阔，土地上覆盖着无尽的沙子。南方是丛林和湿地，它们为世界提供了生命和水。更远处是平原，有湖泊和丘陵，还有一座大山。它是神圣而古老的，有人说，如果你往里面看，你会看到所有生命的曙光，然后它会灼伤你的眼睛和头骨。山的旁边是一个很深的火山口，很宽，从一个边缘到另一个边缘需要走一天的路。在火山口及其周围，他们建造了一座未经训练的眼睛看不见的城市，但如果你知道这条路，那它的景象是令人惊叹的。谭石拔地而起，成为世界的延伸，而不是敌人。这就是宫殿所在的地方，由国王统治。他高大强壮，皮肤黑得像潮湿的土壤，光滑无暇。他以其可怕的力量而美丽，与他所控制的元素融为一体，以至于他在这个世界上进进出出，从不完全在那里，当你看着他时，他总是失去焦点。他的头两侧无毛，在阳光下闪闪发光，但头顶上是一条长长的带子，厚厚的黑色绳索正确地编织在他的头皮上，从他的背上掉进了一条墨色的河里。头发上绑着羽毛和骨头，还有用来炫耀他的经历的小饰品。他既不残忍也不善良，但他对人民的爱根深蒂固，是保护和服务的原始需求。他的人民兴旺发达。首都幅员辽阔，高大茂密的树木在火山口外形成了一个天然的屏障，并定义了城市的边缘——它们扭曲而巨大，与世界上所有知识的山一样古老。那里有更多的野生动物，地面上充满了魔法，生命因其管理而绽放。树木和藤蔓生长在任何可用的空间里，在建筑物和小屋的一侧，一直延伸到天堂。他们掌握着世界的魔力，他们在黑暗中闪闪发光，给人民带来了力量与和平。市场懒洋洋地延伸在圆形城市周围，提供食物、衣服、财富和丰富的色彩和噪音。孩子们会在小巷之间玩耍，而成年人则漫步，从不着急，但总是很忙。可以看到一名女子穿着五颜六色的布料，裹在腰上，披在肩上，以物易物。他们的头发在没有用织物扎紧的情况下，有着复杂的辫子，可以将深色的头发固定在适当的位置。他们是强大的战士。这些人裹着包裹，头上没有头发，许多人拿着骨头做的刀来展示他们的力量。这座城市在白天是充满活力的，在这种生活中有魔力。市场上到处都是药水店，承诺会有爱情、财富和其他任何人想要的东西。拥有粉红色眼睛的元素将绿色的火焰捧在手掌中，看着它随着世界的节奏起舞。萨满将粉末喷向空中，这些粉末会变成火花和颜色，描绘未来或过去。野兽会四处游荡，独自一人，受到人们的尊重。它们是伟大而可怕的节拍，有些巨大而猫科动物，它们有着咬牙切齿的牙齿和厚厚的盔甲皮肤，它们的眼睛像恶魔的火焰一样发出橙色的光芒，但如果它们不被打扰，它们就可以很好地独处。有人说，国王控制着他们，就像他做所有的事情一样，他们都是相互联系的，是彼此的一部分，国王永远不会伤害他的人民。其他生物在火山口外的土地上漫游，分布在平坦的平原上。巨大的毛茸茸的怪物，有着像大象一样有力的长腿，但体型是地面的两倍，它们长着鳞片，有着长长的鼻子和长长的紫色舌头，它们的小眼睛缝会尝到空气的味道，但并没有真正的觉知。当月亮刚刚好的时候，他们喷火而出，他们的哭声因其可爱而令人心碎。有很多奇怪的鸟，它们的羽毛像刀子一样锋利，大量地飞满了空气。他们的哭声很痛苦，唾沫也烧焦了。由于脾气不好，他们经常成为父母告诉孩子们的故事的一部分，以恐吓他们的行为。这个王国幅员辽阔，并非没有暴力，但它在大陆上建立得很好，通常与邻国关系良好。它们是提供美味肉类的动物的圣地，地下的神奇宝石使它们的贸易有利可图。西部的丛林在需要的时候为他们提供了木材和植物，沙漠带来了沙子下所需要的奇怪力量。每个人都提供了一种功能，统治者往往会变得嫉妒和贪婪，开始争夺土地和声望。国王总是不愿意让他的人民毫无理由地参加战斗，但当他们战斗时，他们是一道风景线。长腿和强壮的手臂会对沐浴在嗜血中的对手造成毁灭性的打击，摧毁他们的敌人。他们已经很久没有战争了。在这一天，一位来自北方地区的使者穿过街道，进入火山口，进入宫殿。他望着国王，被压在他皮肤上的巨大力量吓得发抖，从肺里吸了一口气。“遥远的北方有麻烦。”他简单地开始说。这些人从来都不是为了大张旗鼓或不必要的手续。有人告诉他，国王不喜欢浪费时间。“他们变得更具侵略性，派遣侦察队进入我们的土地。他们的水怪攻击我们的船只，使河流干涸。”当他想到自己土地上的人们因脱水而慢慢消瘦时，他的语气有点绝望。“我们的女王表达了她的爱，并请求你们的战士。这个敌人觊觎我们的土地太久了，很久以前我们的祖先就同意他们将拥有遥远的北方，可以自由探索新的土地，但他们却向南移动。他们向愤怒和毁灭的邪恶之神祈祷，他们不会停止，直到世界属于他们，即使他们夺走它时它会燃烧。”国王坐在他的冰和石头制成的宝座上。他的眼睛是黑色的，无底的，太宽了，太诡异了。他静静地坐着，只随着只有他能听到的节拍，有节奏地用手指敲击椅子的扶手。突然，他的眼睛闭上了，头向天空倾斜。他深深地吸了一口气，然后把它放在肺里。他周围的空气在振动，附近的每个人都抓着头，因为他们的皮肤变得太紧了。在他睁开眼睛微笑之前，那是一个永恒的瞬间，一个扭曲的、黑暗的微笑，预示着死亡和黑暗。他的冷静足以说明问题，使者知道这个人，如果他是一个人的话，刚刚与地球本身进行了交流。“我知道这个敌人。我们以前帮助过你们的女王，我们的爱是深沉而强烈的。”他站到了一个不可能的高度，血红色的包裹穿过肩膀，落在了地上。他的脚步让石头震动，爬在王座上的藤蔓拼命地向他伸出，示意他们的国王回来。他把手放在使者的肩膀上，强迫他站起来。他看着自己的眼睛，仍然面带可怕的微笑，这个男人很害怕。“在你到来之前，我就已经想了很久了。”国王轻声说道，但他的声音似乎从房间的各个角落传来。“我不鲁莽。”其他长辈们低声说：“傲慢。”。“告诉你的女王，我们将开战。”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 256, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "“卡洛森大将军，”高长老长着长毛和盔甲的武官向他鞠躬致意，垂下手臂，以示对喀喇昆仑大指挥官的尊重。对于喀喇昆仑帝国来说，时代很艰难，他们与卡尔博尼亚人的战争因与卡纳布人（一种硬壳甲壳类动物，在海洋中以海底为食）相比而遭到诋毁。然而，令人侮辱的是，近两个世纪以来，这些卡纳布人一直在剥夺喀喇昆仑人的领土和喀喇昆仑军事实力。帝国正在崩溃，太阳系开始向卡尔波尼亚人“投降”。卡洛森把他的挎包放在一张破旧的桌子上，这张桌子也是秘书和保安的办公桌。显然，议会中的一些懦夫通过暗杀长老来结束战争。但是，就像所有的战争一样，情况发生了变化。卡洛森在电梯前等着，电梯会把他送到议会会议厅。他的思绪转移到战争刚开始的时候。是的，我们确实开始了这一次。电梯门滑开了，他和武官一起走了进去。我们确实让我们的自负把卡尔博尼亚人推向了一个角落。。。。。说真的，我们明目张胆地抓住了他们建立并正在发展的三个体系。Korafora，或者用Calbolnian人刺耳的语言来说，“Bhaklak”是……嗯，是一个美丽的海洋和岛屿世界。他再也回不去了。曾经他低着头，回忆起自己所目睹的一切。他告诉自己，这是战争，战争中会发生这样的事情，所以不要想。不要想。为了上帝的爱，不要想。卡洛森用力呼气，引起了武官的注意，他带着微弱的微笑点了点头，然后把注意力放回了门上。电梯停了下来，武官带头，这时他注意到武官正在收拾人族的一把Powered.50x75手枪。他看到了这些东西对Calbolnian人的影响，对他们的盔甲的影响，以及对渗透后留下的东西的影响。他用力吞咽，弯起肩膀，跟在后面。回忆又慢慢地回来了。武官打开了一扇凿得很细的木门，这是一片田园林地，哈科里安在树和湖泊周围悠闲地躺着。出于某种原因，他停下来欣赏那一幕。这看起来像一场梦，一个有信仰的人希望再次看到它，尽管他们知道自己永远不会看到。卡洛森知道内心永远不会有这样的平静。他看到了很多。“啊，大将军，我很高兴见到你！”高长老从座位上站了起来，理事会成员也站了起来，他们的情绪似乎比几年前高涨得多。高长老走到他面前，拍了拍他的肩膀，激怒了上次战斗中的一个痛处。“高长老。”卡洛森鞠躬向他的兄弟和朋友致意。“当然还有安理会。”他再次鞠躬。“所以，”G'falon开始说道，“我们赢得了这场战争！这对我们来说是个好消息！”卡洛森看着他的兄弟，然后看着议会，“我想你高估了我们对他们胜利的贡献，兄弟。”卡洛森没有理会他兄弟的皱眉，走到湿酒吧，在那里他自助喝了一杯没有冰的黑水。房间里唯一的声音是水晶玻璃的倾斜声和边缘撞击犬科动物的轻柔叮当声。即使是饮料也洗不掉这些该死的记忆。“一点也不，”当G’falon走近他的兄弟时，他看着委员会皱着眉头的脸。“你应该参加理事会会议的时候，首席国王比提克求我，他当时就求我接受他的投降……啊，兄弟，这是个好日子！”“人族，兄弟……”但G'falon挥手拒绝了。“我们很快就会让他们回到他们的回水系统。”卡洛森轻蔑地笑了起来。“你不知道我们释放了什么，是吗？”卡洛森放下柜台上的玻璃，绕过他的兄弟，看着委员会。人族指挥官是对的，我们看起来确实像他们的狗。。。。。他怎么称呼那些东西，它们的宠物，是的，宠物。“你让我去人族帮我们收拾行李。”他的手臂现在张开，回忆涌上心头。“你告诉我给他们比光速更快的旅行，这样他们就可以按照我们的要求，与卡尔波尼亚人作战。我们开始了一场战争。我想让这场战争深入人心。我们发动了这场战争，而不是卡纳布人，我们，我们在这个房间里。我们推动战争，他妈的卡纳布人接受了我们的提议，像打了我们一样。理事会成员和他的兄弟告诉他，他们不熟悉人族这个词。”但我们赢了。“他的兄弟下定决心地说，几名安理会成员大声表示同意。卡洛森摇了摇头，这些傻瓜就是不明白。”不，不，‘我们’一点都没赢，人族赢了。“当他看到人族步兵时，他的眼睛失去了焦点，他们中的数百万人在Korafora获胜后，由于缺乏补给而挨饿，开始吃掉那些可怜的卡纳布人，这些卡纳布人死了，很快就死了。他们一直在说什么，“面糊？”？“不，”黄油？“是的，黄油，他们所谈论的只是卡纳布人用黄油会好得多。他能听到贝壳被炸开的声音，以及内脏被吞噬时发出的吮吸和吞咽的声音。上帝啊，我们做了什么？”但我们是喀喇昆仑人，这是我们的帝国！当G'falon的手掌重重地拍在柜台上时，委员会开始大力点头，然后指着卡洛森咆哮道：“你要感谢人族为我们的帝国服务，让他们交出任何装有我们FTL发动机的船只，然后把它们全部放回他们的系统中。”。如果他们对此有问题，那么我们会像对待帕拉金队一样把他们放下来。卡洛森平静地看着他的兄弟，然后又看着议会，他本该感到的愤怒并没有像他想象的那样爆发，“正如你所愿，兄弟。”。我会传递你的信息。“他不能告诉他的兄弟他在科拉福拉看到了什么，因为那样他就必须告诉他他在法尔科蒙看到了什么。法尔科门是一座被摧毁的喀喇昆仑城市。在那里，人族也在吃死人，而且正在死亡，但这一次是喀喇昆仑人填饱了肚子，在某些情况下，是他们自己的肚子。这是一场永无止境的噩梦，只有当他去长眠时才会找到平静。他会传达信息，当武官走出房间时，他转向武官，“你可能想离开城堡……”。。。。。很快。为什么？卡洛森想了一会儿，“因为我要去踢一个巨人，如果我们幸运的话，他会像虫子一样把我们压扁。”。”“如果我们运气不好呢？卡洛森走进电梯，按下向上按钮到地面，当门关上时，他回答说：“他会扇我们一巴掌，把我们活活吃掉。”。\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 258, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "“今天？对吧，爸爸？”斯图尔特看着儿子，嘴角掠过一丝微笑。很难想象，他的大部分生活记忆都是在这个不比他们客厅大的洞里创造的。“是的！不过特伦特还有几个小时。尽量保持忙碌。”他对儿子报以安慰的微笑，拍了拍他的背，然后直视他的眼睛。“记住，我和你一样兴奋，但我们不知道外面发生了什么。这可能很可怕，也可能很快乐。尽管如此，我们需要为任何事情做好准备，所以记住我们最近谈论的所有安全预防措施。”特伦特的目光与另一个无辜的目光相匹配，转身回到了他的Cheerios。斯图尔特希望自己能像年幼的儿子一样充满希望，但事实是他非常害怕。他们在这里被困了一年多，确切地说是384天，他害怕外面会看到什么。战争已经开始，他听到的最后一条信息是整个东南部的生物战和核武器警告。这足以让他抓住特伦特，然后来到这里。轰炸持续了23天，在他知道以后，他可能再也看不到地面了。但他现在不得不这样做，因为他们已经完全没有食物了，而且一天比一天更接近饥饿。与其在这里慢慢消磨，不如试试运气。这是他欠儿子的。斯图尔特完成了最后的准备工作；检查他用旧塑料制作的临时“刀”的锋利程度，以及特伦特和他自己会用的衣服条。一切都很顺利，他把儿子叫了过来，尽量让他听起来充满希望。“好吧，你们都把大家伙捆起来了？”特伦特点点头，举起双臂，表示他想被抓住。“出去！！”他高兴地尖叫着。斯图尔特的头因可能发生的可能性而旋转，但他设法把儿子抱起来，朝门上的门闩走去。它几乎已经生锈了，所以推了几下，门才动起来。几次尝试后，他的手臂因期待而颤抖，但都失败了。阳光开始慢慢照进来，使他倒退到黑暗中。他稳住胳膊，恢复了镇静，向梯子上走了几步，一头扎进了未知的世界。阳光照射得如此猛烈，Stew感觉自己好像被一个未被选中的左截击中了，就像四分卫一样。在这么长时间没有任何感觉之后，气氛的重量压在了他的肩上。几分钟过去了，他才觉得舒服得眯起了眼睛。他周围都是摩天大楼，高得看不见顶部。这只能被描述为轻轨和过山车轨道在它们之间盘旋的组合。每隔几秒钟就会有东西在铁轨上闪烁，几乎不足以让他登记。就在他正前方，他的房子被一个玻璃泡完全取代了。在他的左右两侧是其他的地块，前面只有这些气泡。这一轮被泥土和红土覆盖，到处看不到一丝绿色。太阳直射下来，使他裸露的皮肤发痒。“代码4201！代码4201”来自附近的扬声器。一件看起来像充气太空服的东西从几块地上向他们跑来。他背上绑着一根软管。斯图尔特就在这时听到了。特伦特环顾四周时，开始在他耳边大声尖叫。孩子的手好像在抓他的脸。“爸爸！！太疼了！！太难受了！！”妈的。求你了。这不可能发生。斯图尔特把儿子们的手向后拉，审视着他的脸。泡芙在他的皮肤上迅速形成，渗出粘稠的黄色液体。他的左眼肿了，有高尔夫球那么大。“没关系，伙计。只是不要碰你的脸。”他试图平静地说，然后对着跳到他身边但仍在一百多码外的人影大声呼救。斯图尔特把手放在特伦特的眼睛上，尽他所能提供一点保护，特伦特开始大声尖叫。一种刺耳的声音让他不寒而栗，心跳加速。他所能想到的就是站在那里，吓得面瘫。人影离他们越来越近，放慢了速度，慢跑并最终步行，同时将软管向前伸出。一团白色的薄雾正慢慢地从它的尖端进入。“帮帮我！！我的儿子需要帮助！！Stew吼道。他的话落在了一只似乎充耳不闻的耳朵上，而薄雾继续笼罩着他。特伦特无情的尖叫声在他的脑海中蔓延。恐慌笼罩着他的身体。他感觉到手上有什么温暖的东西，看到一股鲜血顺着特伦特的脸流了下来。他吓坏了，把手拉开，看到儿子们的脸被鲜血淹没，鲜血从他睁开的地方喷涌而出。Stewart的目光从特伦特受伤的脸转向了自己的手，他慢慢地向后倒进了白色的薄雾中。他的手指沐浴在深红色之中。”。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 270, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "我今天早上刚做完这件事，算不算？Mods，如果没有，请删除。我跌跌撞撞地上了公交车，坐在靠近后面的座位上，调整口袋里的一瓶百加得。我环顾四周，试图解决我视野的转变。我左边的一个看起来像中东的年轻人，可能20多岁，盯着车外的雪。在我的右边，一个年纪较小的亚洲孩子，可能刚从高中毕业，手里拿着一部崭新的智能手机。他吸引了我的目光，从他的角边眼镜后面给了我一个简短的微笑，然后把注意力转移到他的手机上。车门刚关上，一名年长的亚洲男子就上了车，向后面走去。公共汽车开始开动，我抓住座位稳住了自己。一个外科口罩，或者类似的东西，盖住了这个男人的脸。他为什么有它？这里的空气质量一点也不差。事实上，这太棒了！真的没有必要让任何人穿那种东西。我靠在右边的孩子身上，试着说一些类似“他认为这会让他活得更长吗？”，但结果是“氦活得更长？”他看着我，把手机塞进豌豆大衣的一个口袋里。“什么？”“氦的寿命更长？”“嗯……我真的不确定你想说什么，”他说。我谴责我缺乏控制，然后我再试一次，用另一种方式重新陈述这个问题。“你真的认为空气质量有那么糟糕吗？”我问，并向老人点了点头。他很快看了看，然后转过身来。“不，我认为这里的空气很好，这家伙可能只是不想生病，或者不想让其他人生病。我怀疑这是因为空气质量。”也许这家伙以前从未真正呼吸过。他现在还能呼吸吗？我分不清他穿了什么衣服。也许我会启发他什么是真正的呼吸。这让我非常高兴。“当你呼吸的时候，是你自己的呼吸吗？空气是属于你的吗？”他看起来很困惑。“嗯，是的，我想我呼吸了。”“是的，但是，呼吸属于你吗？”“我真的不认为呼吸属于我……毕竟，这只是空气。”他不理解。我看得出来。他从来没有在寒冷的冬夜呆在小屋里，走出去，呼吸一口真正属于他的呼吸。他从来没有机会。我放声大笑，为他没有机会而感到难过。“如果你想要属于你的空气，就去不列颠哥伦比亚省。”“啊，我从来没有去过。你觉得那里的空气很好吗？”“是的，真的很好……”但不列颠哥伦比亚省也有自己的问题，尤其是熊。我可能应该警告他。“但你知道，熊有时会上去攻击人！我大约230磅。你认为你有多重？”“可能在130磅左右。”我今年230岁。他130岁了。这是…360加起来。这看起来可能足够接近一只熊的大小。“好吧，把我-230，你-130想象成一只站在你面前的熊。你会怎么做？你怎么让它不吃你？你想过这样的情况吗？你真的应该这样做。”。这家伙对熊一无所知！我现在告诉他这是件好事。“当一只熊面前有肉的时候，你以为它会想吃一些浆果吗！？”他什么也没说，只是好奇地看着我。他的头发看起来很整齐，让我想起了年轻的香港文化。“你是香港小孩吗？”他惊讶地睁大了眼睛。“我很惊讶你能分辨出来。有时我甚至无法分辨香港人和内地人之间的区别。”。“我的意思是，你可以看出有些人来自香港，因为他们说英语的方式。不是说他们真的有中国口音，而是更多地是按照他们小时候的英语教学方式-英语的语调与美式英语和英式英语不同。有点像两者的混合。”香港人学的是英式英语？我从来不知道。“那么，你能分辨出他们和皇室之间的区别吗？比如国王说话的方式等等？”“什么？我真的不确定你的意思。”我不知道该怎么表达这个问题。我现在在哪里？我离黑刺有多远？“我们现在在哪里？你在哪里下车？”那最好给我妻子打电话。我拿出我那糟糕的诺基亚公用手机，拨了她的号码。告诉她我在哪里，我正在路上。挂断电话，把它塞回我的毛衣口袋里。“那你在学什么？”“我在学计算机工程。”“那你去哪儿了？”“可能是某个办公室的工作。写软件。”哈！这个孩子！我又笑了。这就是他认为的生活的全部吗？他什么时候有时间真正享受自己？“你觉得这会很有成就感吗？”我问道，眼睛睁得大大的，脸上挂着笑容。“好吧，工作就是工作。这不一定是关于我是否真的喜欢它，但如果我能赚钱做我想做的事，让我快乐，我认为这很有成就感。”。一个愚蠢的孩子在操作车床时戴着手套。最简单的规则之一。手套被机器夹住了。撕裂了他的整个手臂。“我有一个儿子，我可能会教他我所知道的关于安全的一切。如何照顾自己。”“他多大了？”。也许我应该改一下。“这里，这里，”我说。我从口袋里掏出我的TTC日卡。“你认为你的反应能力有多好？”“实际上相当糟糕。”我们笑了。“把你的手指这样放——”我把拇指和食指分开一厘米，好像我要捏什么东西。这是一个朋友不久前给我看的把戏。那孩子也跟着做了，我把球传给了他准备好捏的手指。“我不想让它掉下来。试着抓住它。我给你三次尝试。”“三次尝试？如果我能抓住它，我能赢吗？”我笑了。即使有奖品，他也不会得到。我朋友说是气压之类的。我自己真的不明白。我所知道的是，我也从来没能抓到它。我们进行了三次审判。他什么时候都不明白。“那你知道什么是你抓不到的吗？”“正如我所说，可能是因为我的反应不好。”“不，但你知道这是事实吗？你抓不住它？”“我不完全确定你的意思。”等等，我现在在哪里？我坐这辆公共汽车多久了？我错过站点了吗？我环顾四周，试图一窥周围的环境。“我们现在在哪里？”“斯蒂尔和贝维尤。我们现在要转入贝维尤了。”“还是91路公交车，对吧？”“是的，是91路。”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 271, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "我只是想要一个hoagie。真正地这就是全部！有这么多问题吗？相反，我最终遇到了一个恶魔，名叫霍吉。认真地我想说我尝到了讽刺的味道，但这真的只是雪上加霜。我刚下班回家，我饿极了。我想如果我不吃东西，我可能真的会死。（这可能有点夸张，但我是一个只会绝对思考的千禧一代。）我把冰箱里的所有原料都弄得一团糟：肉、奶酪、芥末。。。哦，芥末。只要我活着，我就再也不会相信芥末了。我把一个硬卷撕成两半。甚至迫不及待地想用刀把它切成薄片——我太累了。饥饿。我塞了一些火鸡胸脯肉，拍了一片切达干酪，摇了摇芥末，以避免出现看起来总是比实际商品早的淡芥末水。我把盖子盖上，把一些和剩下的一起挤到卷里，然后转身把它放回冰箱。你看，我吃过太多次东西都忘了，所以很累。他妈的大错误。当我转身时，我听到一声低沉的嗡嗡声，几乎就像我冰箱发出的声音。。。但不完全如此。我把头歪向一边，更加认真地听着，以为我上世纪90年代的冰箱终于放弃了这场激烈的战斗。嗡嗡声越来越大。震动开始使我的调料架嘎嘎作响，起初很微妙，但越来越强烈。嗡嗡声在几秒钟内变成了沉闷的咆哮声，因为我四肢着地在冰箱下面寻找电器坏了的迹象。一道耀眼的闪光像冲击波一样从我的台面上传播开来，我的晚餐（我永远不会吃）无辜地坐在那里，等待着消除我的饥饿，让我所有的梦想成真。光线是奇怪的红色，当我面对我的冰箱时——同样，这一切在几秒钟内发生了——我隐约想起了一部电影，里面有一个住在冰箱里的超自然生物，生活在一片广阔无尽的荒地上。突然间，我的厨房又恢复了原来的样子。罐子和罐头的嘎嘎声停止了，咆哮声消失了，让我怀疑自己是不是刚刚被饥饿引起的癫痫发作。唉，没有这样的运气。我转过身去看我那命运多舛的三明治，发现一个恶魔蹲在那里。不到一英尺高，它仰面坐着，狠狠地打量了我一番。如果你从来没有被魔鬼检查过，我不建议你这样做。这东西是一个尘土飞扬的红色，有鳞，手和躯干一样大，末端是爪子，它在柜台上耙来耙去。保证金到了。我们对视了整整十秒钟，这种眼神比我大多数的一夜情都要亲密。它用一种奇怪的喉音喃喃自语。我的脸上立刻流露出我的困惑，这显然让这个小混蛋很高兴。用英语，它咆哮着说：“我来了。谢谢你的搭车。”他妈的，我心想。癫痫发作的可能性越来越大。在我正在经历的这片奇异的新土地上，我决定一起玩。当我躺在厨房地板上时，这只是我的潜意识，那么有什么害处呢？“不客气，我想。”没有人说我必须聪明。“现在我自由了，你想惹什么麻烦？”它露出牙齿，顽皮地咧嘴笑着，这种表情把我吓得魂飞魄散，幻觉见鬼去吧。“你在说什么？你是谁？”“我的名字是我的货币，你还没有赚到。”我考虑过这个问题。这看起来像是一个坚实的恶魔逻辑。“你从哪里来的？”“下面。”“好吧，”我故意说，“你是怎么到这里的？”。“你他妈的在说什么，小家伙？我饿了。我只想吃三明治，坐在该死的沙发上。”我还没来得及把手放下来，它就已经从柜台上掉了下来。那些怪异的爪子，用十把破烂的匕首，压在我的头两侧。我从手指间向外窥视，看到它闪闪发光的黑眼睛离我只有几英寸远。“不要。打电话给我。那个。”“你召唤了我。你画了符号，”它咆哮着说。“我不知道你是怎么画的，也不知道是谁让你画的。事实仍然是，你召唤我，在你画出反曲之前，我会留在这里，和你在一起。”。“我回想起我一直在做的事情，幻觉前。如果这是幻觉。它看起来有点太真实了——你不应该在梦中感到疼痛，对吧？我太阳穴上的爪子是现实的苦涩味道。我后退脚步，思考着……芥末？他妈的芥末？？？它笑了，看到我正在把碎片拼在一起。我知道我是偶然召唤它的。我不知道这个小大便能读懂多少人的思想，但让我告诉你，它不止一点点。当它意识到我无法把它送回去，无法画出相反的方向时，它松开了头，恢复了放松的姿势，这次是在它透过腐烂的牙齿说：“我叫霍吉。我们将一起玩得很开心。\"", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 272, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "灯光的闪烁似乎终于引起了他胃里的恐惧。他身后的门微微半开着，对着外面的世界，由建筑的一部分支撑着——向走廊另一端的内脏生物招手。这让所有在H-Tead工作的科学家都感到震惊，他们的实验适应得如此之快。它一开始很受尊敬，在第一次大测试后，它碰着香槟酒杯，它还活着，茁壮成长！然而，又过了一周，这个生物发展成了比他们想象的更阴险、更激烈的东西。灯光闪烁着，威胁着他唯一的安全保障。不到一个小时前，他的助手玛丽一直在审查该项目评估的前额叶皮层报告。他们负责大脑活动，监测水平，并保持进展，以快速的速度产生。正是他们的成功，再加上命运，或者可能只是在需要的时候的愚蠢，很快就会导致他们的灭亡。“我不知道为什么，帕克，但我有这种感觉——我只是觉得我们不能这样扮演上帝。”玛丽一直对实验室的工作感到不安。H-Tead以其在生物战方面的新进展而闻名，一直处于前沿。在过去的几个月里，来自几个国家的将军们参观了实验室，他们的脑海和心中充满了“你会为你的国家做什么”的演讲。帕克对此嗤之以鼻。这就是这里的策略，他知道，在公司的七年已经向他证明了这一点。十年前，亚洲以极其残忍和陈旧的生化战术占领了许多欧洲国家。来自小国的领导人纷纷涌向H-Tead，希望能有任何东西武装他们的部队，对抗亚洲战争这场巨大而无情的闹剧。北美和盟军似乎对他们的抵抗最大，但时间本身就是一个迫在眉睫的敌人。H-Tead在创业之初就开发了一种弹头，这似乎摧毁了敌国的军事化，但已经过去了好几年。由于政治影响，盟军总统错过了一个消灭威胁的机会，当时敌人已经全力反击。因此，他们转向了一种不同的策略，一种在生物体内的超级病毒，它可以在敌人的领土内传播和部署，在攻击时具有情报和卓越的解决问题的技能。它是成功的，测试以惊人的速度通过。这种生物可以为社会和数学问题找到解决方案，也可以了解周围的世界。声纳探测系统无法追踪它，这是革命性的。然而，在发展过程中的某个地方，科学家们受到了很大的影响，使这种病毒具有更兽性的性质。盟军的将军们希望让这个有机体尽可能地冷酷无情，不易受到人类思想中与战争有关的道德弱点的影响。玛丽和其他人担心，将这些特征配对可能会重叠并破坏精心设计的荷尔蒙平衡，并将生物体变成对其“主人”来说难以控制和高度危险的东西。“玛丽有什么不同？半个世纪以来，人们一直在设计自己的孩子。这只是这些选择的一个变体。”帕克微笑着问她，他坐在她旁边，看着将军们提供给他们的指示文件。他也不同意这对搭档，但扮演魔鬼代言人，看着玛丽变得如此热情，这很有趣——这是他最喜欢的部分。她摇了摇头，束起的头发在脸上弹来弹去。她疲惫的眼睛恳求他站在她一边，在改造前找人来控制这个项目，但她的声音因不确定而沙哑。“人们不会把老虎的部分放在孩子身上，帕克。”玛丽是对的，但当他查看文件时，老虎的举止与他们为项目准备的相比相形见绌。帕克德已经计划否决这些计划，但随着他继续阅读，他的紧迫感增强了。撞车。一声尖叫。警报器。玛丽从椅子上弹了起来，把椅子撞倒在地，加剧了随之而来的灾难。帕克看着她走向视频屏幕，播放了几段将军们违反协议并在未经评估的情况下插入激素和细胞的片段。她转向帕克，疲惫的目光被悲伤所取代。她不想说得对，但已经接受了即将到来的命运。在她身后，视频显示尸体被大量屠杀，弹药和炮火无法与生物体DNA中的反应防御系统水平相匹配。玛丽冲出门，“我们必须阻止它！”他知道她要去哪里，控制室就在大厅下面，但他似乎被房间对面的视频惊呆了。当她到达控制室时，他看着饲料，就在天花板的一部分开始因组织者的抗议和对它的攻击而摇晃时。帕克知道自己的命运已经注定，他们唯一的防御就是遏制。他决定向大厅走去，视频以建筑物和弹片从电缆上撕裂而告终。玛丽知道他们必须结束这个设施，这是一个自毁装置，但必须有两个人开始这个序列，而她没有足够的权限通过计算机推翻这样的政策。帕克在所有东西变黑之前的最后一次喂食中瞥见了这种生物，但他只是全神贯注于从生物的头骨中伸出的闪闪发光的红色眼睛。在起源时，他们曾经是一个温顺的绿色，充满了奇迹，现在他们似乎只是怀有一种帕克从未见过的复仇。当他最终进入走廊时，灯又亮了起来，但突然的浪涌导致几个镇流器燃烧，给他留下了一个诡异的闪烁场景。朝下，有人冲到大厅下面的房间里，玛丽和帕克的眼睛似乎呆滞了。这就是结局。两个人就足够开始这个序列了，而他现在所拥有的只是转瞬即逝的瞬间。帕克眼前闪现着一种简单的生活，太多的中国外卖和发光的电视屏幕。他快乐吗？当然他做得够多了吗？就在这时，帕克突然看到了门口的出口，被一些天花板瓷砖挡住了。他必须清理这条路，不会逃跑——倒计时已经开始，时间有限，需要控制生物体进行破坏。咆哮。帕克转过身来，当他的眼睛看到荷尔蒙对他们的项目所做的转变时，他屏住了呼吸。他感到了玛丽自宣布这一消息以来一直保持的恐惧，他也感到遗憾的是，他没有以更大的力度对抗那些正在终结他们生计的伎俩。这只生物意识到了眼前的情况，似乎在帕克向前爬行时对他傻笑。它们的腿曾经是像人一样的动作，现在在野兽旁边弯曲成90度角，可以在地板上像蜘蛛一样移动。帕克听到警报声，转身朝门口走去，避开了迫在眉睫的存在，踢开了最后一块碎片，关上了门。他能感觉到造物的存在正在向他逼近，他知道自己已经完了。最后的嗡嗡声响起。帕克德悲伤而痛苦地喊道，一只长着爪子的人形手从他的胸口伸了出来。当他被向后扔到地板上的一堆时，他很快就把门锁掉了下来，看着野兽从他身边向出口走去。他做得够多了吗？一道白光。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 298, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "迈克尔背靠着洞穴的岩壁，叹了一口气。“安德鲁，这都是你的错，你知道，”斯泰西说。在黑暗中，迈克尔看不见安德鲁的脸，但他想象着自己在扭曲嘴巴，就像在吃酸东西一样。“我意识到，史黛西，这就是为什么我想办法摆脱这场混乱。”安德鲁的声音有些低沉。“我告诉你，这是没有出路的。我们完全迷路了，很可能会死在这里。”空气又热又压抑。迈克尔擦了擦额头上的汗。“没必要这么悲观，斯泰西。我的意思是，我相信我们能找到出路，对吧？”汤姆试图掩饰自己的不安，但没有成功。迈克尔环顾四周，想象着他的三个同伴在他最后一次见到他们的地方，然后他们关掉手电筒以节省电池。他想象着他的好朋友安德鲁，他说服了他们四个人站在那里，交叉着他结实的手臂探索洞穴。他想象汤姆坐在地上，膝盖紧贴着脸。他想象着斯泰西坐在她的男朋友旁边（汤姆和斯泰西是如何建立关系的，迈克尔无法理解），四肢伸开，姿势可以用随意来形容。一个冒险家，一个懦夫，一个娇生惯养的公主。迈克尔不喜欢他们活下来的几率。汤姆的问题仍然悬而未决。有人移动得很不舒服。迈克尔又擦了擦额头，开口说话。“我们最好的选择可能是继续流浪，但我们需要以某种方式标记我们去过的地方。只要我们保持距离，一次只使用一个手电筒，我们最终一定会找到出路。”“假设我们不会渴死或掉进坑里，”斯泰西喃喃自语。汤姆打开手电筒一会儿，然后又退了回来。“瓶子里还有大约四分之三。”只有汤姆带了一个水瓶。他们其余的人只带了手电筒。当他们意识到他们迷路了，汤姆主动提出分享他的水。迈克尔估计这大约发生在十分钟前，但他们谁也说不清时间。“好吧，我们先用我的手电筒。汤姆，你抓住瓶子。让我们尽量少喝水。”迈克尔打开手电筒，站了起来。他在洞穴的地面上发现了一块拳头大小的石头，就把它捡了起来。他用它在墙上画了一条线，发现它留下了一个白色的粉笔状的痕迹。“安德鲁，拿着这个，每隔五英尺左右在我们右边的墙上做一个标记，”迈克尔一边说，一边把石头扔给他的朋友。有一段时间，一切都很顺利。每当有不止一条路要走的时候，迈克尔就带领团队向右走，他们似乎正在慢慢地向水面前进。有一次，他们发现由于墙上的标记，向右走会把他们带成一个大圈，所以他们改为向左走。这一发现后不久，汤姆突然大哭起来。迈克尔转过身来，把手电筒照在汤姆惊恐的脸上。“我听到了什么。”他的声音几乎是耳语。迈克尔把手电筒指向汤姆凝视的方向。他只看到岩石。“如果你再发出这样的声音，我就阉割你，”斯泰西嘶嘶地说。看了她一眼脸，迈克尔就知道她和汤姆一样害怕。“让我们继续前进，”安德鲁说。他们的进度放慢了。在某个时候，迈克尔的手电筒变得很暗，很难看到，所以斯泰西走在了前面，似乎每隔几步她就会转过身来，看看黑暗中是否有什么东西跟着他们。安德鲁试图开始对话，但很快就没了。突然，斯泰西停了下来，迈克尔差点撞到她。“你是什么？”“我需要喝一杯。”汤姆一声不吭地把瓶子递给她。史黛西拿起一口大燕子，把它递了回来。他们正要继续他们的未知之旅，突然一声洗牌声把他们都冻住了。史黛西转过身来，面对着声音，不一会儿，他们瞥见了它。它的形状隐约是人的，尽管它肯定比普通人高。它的眼睛反射光线的方式几乎让人眼花缭乱，但它身体的其他部分是黑色的，有阴影。直到迈克尔看着那东西的眼睛，他才真正理解了邪恶。它的目光似乎伸了出去，抓住了他，让他窒息而死。斯泰西的手电筒照了很长时间，刚好让他们看到它慢慢地向他们走去，然后电池就没电了。迈克尔打开手电筒，从尖叫的同伴身边掠过，像个疯子似的跑了起来。手电筒非常昏暗，但这并不重要。重要的是远离。。。不管那是什么。迈克尔认为自己是一个知识渊博的人，并认为他的计划是万无一失的，但他没有考虑到怪物、魔鬼或鬼魂。当谈到超自然现象时，他持怀疑态度，也就是说，直到他看着那双眼睛。在某个时刻，他筋疲力尽地停止了奔跑。几分钟后，令迈克尔惊讶的是，安德鲁和斯泰西在安德鲁的手电筒的指引下出现了。“汤姆在哪里？”安德鲁和斯泰西互相看了一眼。安德鲁把光照向他们来的地方，然后慢慢地摇了摇头。迈克尔叹了一口气，坐了下来。他们又回到了原点，但这次少了一个水瓶，少了一名懦夫。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 303, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "这花了将近六个月的时间，但路易斯终于在阿卡普尔科找到了一位调酒师，他有仙人掌，可以做出一份像样的Caipirinha。酒吧里挤满了毒枭和妓女，但他们都与路易斯保持距离。四年前，当他来到镇上时，他就成了抢劫的目标，但有传言称，那些试图抢劫他的人最终走错了路。现在他们让他一个人喝酒。他们没有打扰他，他也没有打扰他们。当那个穿着紫色连衣裙的女人走进酒吧时，路易斯差点从凳子上摔下来。她有一头乌黑的长发，苍白的皮肤，一双蓝色的眼睛正盯着他。她和他一样。他只是知道。她穿过酒吧，无视嘘声和粗鲁的西班牙语评论，把凳子停在他旁边。“我该找到你了。”她带着淡淡的英国口音说。然后用一口流利的西班牙语，带着西班牙口音，对酒保说：“Tengo sed。Una Corona por青睐。”“你是谁？你是什么？”Luiz忍不住瞪大了眼睛。这不是她的美丽，尽管她很美丽。她显然和他一样不老。“让我们从你开始，”她回答。“我确信你出生在1945年8月6日，肯去世了。但你是在哪里出生的？到目前为止生活怎么样？”“你怎么知道我的生日？”“对不起，我真的很粗鲁。”女人叹了口气，在凳子上挺直了姿势，把裙子拖到大腿下一点，喝下半杯啤酒，然后重新开始。“我是维奥莱特。和你一样，我也是40个人中的一员。我相信你在1970年左右就发现了，你有点与众不同。你停止衰老了。你很少受伤。你比周围的大多数人更快、更强、更聪明。路易斯发现自己不由自主地点了点头。“我们有40个人吗？”？”“我真的是你第一次见面吗？我以为可能是这样，但不能确定。维奥莱特笑了。“我们中的一些人一起努力，试图管理我们之间的和平，但也有一些无赖，你可能会遇到他们。”谈话停顿了一下。路易斯试图弄清楚他想从一千个问题中的哪一个开始。她先打破了沉默。“所以我认为你是巴西人。”。“她指着他的饮料。”正如你所说，1945年8月6日出生于里约。你怎么知道的？她叹了一口气，甚至看起来有点悲伤，但回答说：“那是肯去世的日子。”。“我们经常用不朽这个词，但你并不是完全不朽的。”。有办法杀死神仙。它们通常非常可怕，但当它发生时，一个新的不朽者诞生了。总有40个。1945年，肯艰难地认识到，核武器是永生不死的途径之一。“路易斯不知道该说什么。他知道自己的生日和广岛爆炸案是同一天，但从未想过自己的奇怪状况可能与此有关。”无论如何，我很高兴找到了你。维奥莱特继续说道：“很高兴能在这里呆上几天，回答你的问题，享受海滩。”。但最重要的是，我需要你和我一起去巴黎。”“巴黎，为什么是巴黎？”“我们这些神仙几乎从不见面。正如你很快就会了解到的那样，我们不太喜欢对方，但我们已经建立了自己的领导委员会，他们将于2017年4月会面，讨论一些困难的情况。我出生在公元1000年左右，但我们中的一些人已经几千岁了。我们中没有人见过技术发展如此之快。这引发了新的问题。“我想我没有更好的事情可做了。”路易斯看着他的饮料。“这是400多年来的第一次强制性会议。”。既然我找到你了，你就得来。其他大多数人并不真的想担心找到你，但我把它作为我的使命。“路易斯感觉到维奥莱特没有告诉他关于最后一条隐晦评论的事情。路易斯无话可说。突然他感觉到身后有人。他转过身来，看到了巴勃罗，一个当地的暴徒，口臭，脸左侧有一道丑陋的疤痕。”巴西利诺，你今天遇到的这位女士真漂亮。你和她分手后能给我一块吗？”“巴勃罗，现在真的不是时候。“路易斯感觉到他的怒火高涨。维奥莱特坐在那里礼貌地微笑着。“哦，来吧，只是几个吻，”巴勃罗笑着，他的手伸下来抓住维奥莱特的大腿。路易斯站起来反抗。但他不需要他。维奥莱抓住这名男子的手臂，扭了扭，直到酒吧里的每个人都听到砰的一声，然后啪的一声把他从最近的桌子扔了出去。枪和刀都拔了出来。酒吧老板简短地请求大家保持冷静，然后打到酒吧下面的甲板上。子弹开始飞了。四分钟后，维奥莱特和路易斯离开了酒吧。“看来我们不能留在这里享受海滩了。”。让我们上路吧。到墨西哥城只需大约六个小时。我租的车在街对面的停车场。“路易斯简直不敢相信自己刚刚经历的一切。他在一次又一次的枪击和刀具中幸存下来，但当他的新同事解除武装并系统性致残或杀死一个人又一个人时，他经历了一场全面的交火，这是他从未试过的。他从未测试过自己的不朽或力量有多大。他的想法被维奥莱特打断了。”但让我们先在商店停下来。我被裙子撕破了，有一些污渍。我讨厌不时髦的旅行。“她漫步到最近的商店。路易斯发现自己的生活在过去的一个小时里被颠覆了，于是跟了上来。这是我40个不朽故事的一部分。之前的故事[在这里]（https:）。”。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 304, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "对WP的第一次响应，提示引发了一些事情。一定要温柔。汤姆关掉引擎，坐在空荡荡的停车场里，等警察来。这将是他第九次生命的结束，这是他迄今为止最短的一次生命。手里拿着冰冷的钢枪，汤姆回想起母亲第一次去世前的情景。在汤姆的成长过程中，他认识的这个女人热情和蔼，意志坚定，即使是她的丈夫和她唯一孩子的父亲和她姐姐一起抛弃她，也不会使她的精神黯然失色。她把所有的精力都倾注在汤姆身上，汤姆爱她胜过爱她。那是在她被一辆12吨重的卡车撞倒之前，这辆卡车的司机喝醉了，情绪低落。几个月后的重建手术和治疗接踵而至，给他的母亲留下了对从前自我的猥亵扭曲。她的事故剥夺了她的双腿和运动能力，这是她唯一能与对儿子的爱相抗衡的激情。汤姆习惯了一个人去网球场，而他的母亲则躺在沙发上，抓着烧得像火一样发痒的伤口，绝望地尖叫，因为她想起自己在这个地狱里还有八条命。他自己的第一次死亡发生在他母亲出事四年后，当时他15岁。他在学校里遇到的人群很糟糕，但派对根本不是。尤其是当约翰·麦克纳尔蒂把它们扔出去的时候。一天晚上，约翰哥哥的一些朋友走过来，带来了一袋袋奇怪的小药丸。汤姆喝了一杯廉价的伏特加，对约翰哥哥的女友格里·弗拉纳根产生了强烈的欲望，当晚他吃了太多有趣的药丸，最后死了。汤姆带着一种意想不到的喜悦进入了他的第二人生。即使他在布拉德菲尔德青少年罪犯研究所的工作也无法打破这种新发现的浮力，即使他们会踢他的球，直到他哭了，或者几个特定的勤务兵会在淋浴时操他。当他们剥光他的衣服打他并向他吐口水时，他可以直视他们的眼睛，因为他知道自己还有八条命要复仇。他们因此憎恨他。当他回到家，再次看到他的母亲，浑身起泡，粗糙地躺在客厅的地毯上，自言自语，他知道他现在无法停止。接下来的五年过得很好，汤姆的生活就像机场惊悚片中的章节一样燃烧。亮点？他与约翰和男孩们一起完成的银行抢劫案总是轰动一时，其中一次大胆的抢劫案以汤姆被一名过于热心的新手警察射中胸部而告终。这些努力的资金资助了他其他几次更为壮观的死亡——在珠穆朗玛峰上，雪崩将他（不幸的是，还有少数夏尔巴人）消灭。他在南非度过了一个浮潜假期，如果没有那条鲨鱼从他的右臂上取下一大块并导致大量失血，这个假期将足够令人难忘。当然，还有其他的死亡，他至少深情地回顾着。蜜月当晚，Gerri因吸食可卡因与Gerri发生争执，最终Gerri将Gerri推下酒店阳台，这让Gerri感到尴尬（他离泳池约5英寸）。他喜欢假装台湾妓院里的色情窒息事件从未发生过。但他们都是过去的生活，汤姆心想。过去的死亡。现在只有这一刻。他能听到警笛声。在他身后，布拉德菲尔德青少年罪犯研究所一片火海。他希望孩子们的死亡能给他们一个重新开始的机会，并比他更好地利用这个机会。他希望使用他的勤务兵会被烧焦，直到他们没有生命。在他面前，他可以看到红色和蓝色的灯光。他重新启动发动机，以每小时90英里的速度冲向他最后也是最致命的死亡。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 329, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "羞耻这是我从记事起就联想到学校的词。我最早的记忆是在幼儿园为一位同学的生日表演舞蹈。如果我一个人跳舞的话，也许不会那么糟糕，但我们总是一起跳很多音乐。我的是拍手之间唯一的一声。当孩子们旋转时，我绊倒了。当它们跳跃和翱翔时，我像布娃娃一样扑腾着。我们还没跳到一半，他们就笑得合不拢嘴，指着我。一开始我很震惊，但后来我变得非常尴尬和羞愧，就像我被抓到脱裤子一样。我试图躲起来，推过了生日男孩，他摔倒了，头撞在了桌子上。斯旺女士抓住了我的胳膊，把我送到拘留所，在那里我被要求做100个旋转。我做这些疯狂的方式让我头晕、恶心和悲伤。当我做完的时候，我倒在地板上，一边吐一边哭。当我爸爸来接我时，我没有告诉他发生了什么。如果他知道我有多有缺陷，他会否认我吗？如果他知道他的儿子不能做其他人都能做的事情，他会有多羞愧？那天晚上，我不吃晚饭，很早就上床睡觉了。第二天，生日男孩的座位是空的。显然，父母不希望他们的孩子和我在同一个班。有传言说，如果人们在我身边呆得太久，他们也会失去跳舞和唱歌的能力。日复一日，我的同学们一个接一个地回避我，直到一个人也没有了。斯旺女士继续教我经典舞蹈，甚至在下午和晚上花额外的时间陪我。“舞蹈在我们的文化中很重要。如果没有舞蹈，你将如何讨好你的伴侣？你将如何向你的朋友和家人表达你的感激之情？”她说，她的手优雅而毫不费力地在空中追踪着看不见的图案。她的粉色雪纺围巾随着她有节奏的动作轻轻地飘在空中。探戈，弗拉门戈，我跌跌撞撞地穿过它们。我一直在等她放弃，这样我就可以一个人沉浸在耻辱中，但她从来没有这样做过。当我16岁的时候，我不得不选择一所高中，我选择了一所位于城市另一边的高中，远离斯旺女士，远离任何认识我的人。我把它当作重新开始的机会。在我在Dancing High的第一节舞蹈课上，我宣布：“跳舞太过时了。它太差劲了。我想转而从事体育运动！”克莱夫教授的眼睛瞪大了。“拘留你，罗尔夫！今天下午见！”克莱夫教授一边说，一边弹着银色的长刘海，弹了弹手指。“这就是我不喜欢转校生的原因！”他在听得见的范围内喃喃自语。第二天和第二天，克莱夫教授和我跳了一段形象的探戈，结果总是和我一起被拘留。在许多天的结果没有变化之后，克莱夫教授终于放弃了，但让我继续上课。他说：“如果我不能打动你，也许切诺维斯夫人会打动你的灵魂。”。他的努力是徒劳的——我像石头一样静止不动，同学们也和我保持距离。我并不介意。至少他们害怕我。我宁愿那样也不愿怜悯。似乎没有什么能打动我去跳舞。然后，在一个晴朗的秋日，当金色和红色的树叶在空中飞舞时，他走进了我的生活。（待续）", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 348, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "我在浏览我最喜欢的书店时，在书店后面偶然发现了一本书。它看起来好像很久没有人碰过它了。装订褪色，书页发黄。见鬼，它甚至有一股大家都知道的旧书的味道。我敢打赌，当它是新的时候，这本书是华丽的，是对生活热情的缩影。我是这里唯一的顾客。离我家不到五分钟路程的一家小店。由我认识多年的人所有，实际上是一个好朋友。我喜欢这家商店，这本书就是一个很好的例子。这家商店在我朋友买下它之前就已经存在了。我开始读这本书。它的细节几乎到了发球台。这就像在看电影。这本书以黑暗中的光明开始。主角很困惑，但看到了这些东西。恐惧可怕的恐惧和困惑。它几乎是有形的。哦，他太冷了。然后，突然间，一种来自柔软的东西的温暖和对那些它如此害怕的东西的拥抱。这时，我被迷住了。这本书在某种程度上引起了我的共鸣。我不知道是怎么做的，也不知道为什么，但这是一种强烈的感觉。我几乎知道我应该停止阅读，但需要继续阅读，就好像这是冲动。我上瘾了。随着孩子的成长，我一直在读这本书。一切都在那里。这本书的写作风格很奇怪。是的，它很详细，但它从非常强大；事情就像骑自行车，初吻，第一次迷恋，第一次伟大的成就，非常干燥；比如早上的作息、上学、吃午饭。尽管如此，我还是被迷住了。随着岁月的流逝，我读书。有一段非常平凡的时期，孩子正在成长为一个十几岁的孩子。然后，一场巨大的悲剧发生在他身上。14岁时失去母亲。读到这篇文章，我想蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，哭着消除疼痛。我记得我自己的母亲是如何在6年前的这个月去世的。他们都以同样的方式死于一场悲惨的车祸。当时已经是深夜，我们从医院开车回家已经很晚了。她的姐姐在那里接受淋巴瘤治疗。当她开车回家时，泪水顺着她的脸流了下来，今晚早些时候发生的事情的痛苦在她的脸上清晰可见。那是一个寒冷的夜晚，路面光滑，有一层薄薄的黑冰，当我们试图在一层黑冰上停车时，我们被一辆卡车撞成了T形。几个小时后，她在医院去世了，但我只受了轻伤。尽管力量震撼了我的内心。我继续前行。最终，随着时间的推移，疼痛也随之而来。他的母亲去世后，他的父亲变成了一个非常刻薄的人。他曾经强大的振奋精神，变成了同样有毒的精神。他酗酒。杰克·丹尼尔斯是他的得力助手。他为此责怪我。因为妈妈的死。每一个小小的错误都变成了一场斗争，通常以悔恨的话语和鲜血告终。有一次，我在商店行窃被抓了。这些全新的耳机。不幸的是，我不必在监狱里过夜。我一回到家，父亲就开始回击。在开了大约七枪之后，我遇到了言语攻击，这是我父亲的常态。我等着他停下来，期待着反驳，但我却挥了一下。那是我父亲和我第一次打架。当高中时代即将结束时，一种新的兴奋席卷了我。我准备开始我的生活。我一个人，远离他父亲对他的怨恨。远离他的房子承受的痛苦。远离他生命的最后四年我不得不忍受的一切。我上了大学，第二年遇到了我一生的挚爱。我19岁，坠入爱河。这是我一生中最美好的日子。学校很棒，多年来我第一次感到快乐。现在我知道这本书是什么了，但为时已晚。尽管知道会发生什么，我还是坚持阅读。当我的生活继续在我眼前的文字中上演时，我泪流满面。她的名字叫艾丽。我们本打算在大学毕业后结婚的。我们的生活交织在一起，我们的心也交织在一起。我们在一起的那些美好时光。它比我想象的还要强大。然而，生活确实有一种很好的方式可以多次把你踢得屁滚尿流。它考验你的性格和意志，并根据你的收入和成就来评判你，而不是根据你的收获。对生活来说，我没有得到她。她在我们相爱一年后去世了。一个糟糕的选择是，在派对上多找点乐子，这让她住进了急诊室。她说她要和朋友出去玩。她说她两点左右回来。她说我不应该等她，但我还是等了。当两点变成三点，然后变成四点时，我害怕最坏的情况。早上六点左右，我接到电话。她在到达急诊室后不久就因服药过量去世了。这条消息是我几个月来一直沉浸在悲伤之中的一条令人心碎的毯子。我忘记了我的真实身份。我是一个迷失的灵魂。我边读书边生活。上课，作业，苏格兰威士忌，睡眠。几个月来，这是我的日常生活。当我意识到自己在自杀时，我读了起来，并把苏格兰威士忌切了下来。我不会像我父亲那样，也不会像那个苦涩的老人那样。我拒绝了。尽管如此，我还是会比他强。我吃力地看书。六个月后的今天，我并没有好转，我怀疑我是否会好转。我终于走到了今天。我阅读了我的日常生活，然后自己走向这家商店。读这本书以及到目前为止我的每一个反应。页面上的最后一句话是：“我读了最后一句，意识到我赶上了他的生活。下一页是什么？”我不想知道，但我还是翻过了这一页。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 350, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "我在手机闹钟欢快的啁啾声中醒来。我侧身翻了个身，想把它忘掉，醒来时昏昏欲睡的思绪突然被灼热的疼痛所淹没。“啊！”我哭着，从右臂上滚下来，抱着它。“到底是什么？！”我看着它，几乎害怕我会发现什么。然后，混乱像风暴一样滚滚而来，完全令人困惑。我的右前臂上刻着一个单词，两个字母长。GO我退缩了，用另一只手温柔地抚摸着破碎的皮肤。伤口很浅，与其说是真正的切口，不如说是严重的擦伤，伤口已经结痂了。我环顾房间，试图理清思绪。发生了什么事？我睡觉的时候怎么会这样？我停了下来，意识到我不记得昨晚在大厅洗澡后回到房间后发生了什么。我一直在计划为周四的考试复习……我的目光落在了日历上。11月23日。当然一系列的领悟像冰冷的小波浪一样席卷了我。我的家庭不是很。。。。。神秘的他们不喜欢鬼故事之类的东西。但我妈妈喜欢告诉我这件事，当我还是个新生儿的时候，甚至还不到一周大。妈妈会说：“她只是哭着尖叫。”。“我们做的一切都不起作用。我摇晃、唱歌、喂她、给她洗澡。我甚至，“她在这一部分总是看起来有点尴尬，”我甚至对她喊道。“然后爸爸让她在她失去之前把我放下，他们去隔壁房间坐了一会儿，冷静下来，然后再试一次。”。“一开始，她的哭声越来越严重。更严重了！那种让你的血都凉了的尖叫声。我以为她哭得这么厉害会让自己恶心。但后来，就在我再也受不了了，要回托儿所的时候，它……停止了。”她冲进房间，确信我不知怎么哭得受了重伤，结果发现我睡着了，脸紧贴着一件旧黄色羊毛衫的袖子。“我从大学起就没穿过那件羊毛衫，”妈妈会低声说，眼睛越来越大。“我完全忘记了这件事，尽管它被存放在托儿所的壁橱里，里面当时放着很多旧衣服。”爸爸一直和她在一起，家里没有其他人，所以如果他们没有为婴儿拔出羊毛衫，“那是谁？”当然，她当时有点害怕，因为，1）幽灵羊毛衫，2）你不应该把任何东西和婴儿一起放在婴儿床里，因为这会增加婴儿猝死综合症的风险。但它阻止了我哭，所以她把它留在那里陪我，但眼睛和耳朵都很敏锐。很长一段时间以来，我一直以为这只是一个令人毛骨悚然的故事，妈妈喜欢讲这个故事来惹我。别坏了，否则你的幽灵教母会生气的！但随着年龄的增长，我怀疑她可能只是太累了，忘记了自己做。然后，在我十岁生日的那天晚上，我喝得酩酊大醉，徒劳地想在床上睡着，突然，一个哭泣的婴儿和我一起在房间里。没过多久，我就想明白了。四天前，在我二十岁生日那天，我回去看望了十岁的自己。她想知道我是否在上大学（是的），我是否有男朋友（是），以及你18岁后情况是否更凉爽（有点）。她似乎对婴儿期的事情仍然有点厌倦，我们一起发现这似乎是每10年发生一次的事情。但后来我承认，我不记得在我十岁的时候见过20岁的我，但她似乎记得她最近与婴儿的互动，就在那时，我们意识到年轻的自己不会记得，但年长的自己会记得。她问我是否见过30岁的我，我告诉她我没有。“嗯，今天是我生日四天后，”她说。“现在是11月23日。”“我想知道我们还有多长时间？”我说。“直到我们不能再说话了。”这位十岁的女孩似乎对我们的谈话是有限的商品的想法感到恐慌，似乎对下一个问题的紧迫性感到兴奋。“爸爸妈妈，”她说。“妈妈和爸爸……他们是……”她咽了口。“他们为我骄傲吗？”我还没来得及回答，就回到了宿舍。我试着从我10岁时的角度回想和回忆这次访问。什么都没有。现在，我已经对未来进行了探访。至少我知道我会活到30岁。这是一个奇怪的保证，但有些日子太艰难了。阶级、责任、人民。。。。。有些日子，我只是想停下来。GO烧伤了我的手臂，刺痛，温暖。我用肥皂和水洗了它，让我的下巴再次感到刺痛，并试图向从浴室进来的其他女孩隐瞒我在做什么。那天早上我上了有机化学课，下午我上了实验室。当我进行墨水色谱实验时，我的手机在实验室的工作台上震动，我把它和其他东西都放在那里了。我查了一下，是我男朋友发的短信。你从2号过来？想念你，我咬了嘴唇。阿奇和我断断续续地相处了一年多。真的，自从我们开始约会以来。在我的脑海里，我有一种预感，那就是它不会成功，也永远不会成功。但我已经习惯了和他在一起；这就是我不断回去的原因。阿奇似乎并不介意。他只是随遇而安。如果我想休息一下，我们就休息一下。但后来他会邀请我出去玩或其他什么，然后我们又回来了。这很累人，但这只是日常生活的一部分。我抓了抓胳膊，吓了一跳。GO当我出现的时候，其他几个人正在Arch的住处。“我告诉他们你会把它们做成你的专长，”他说。“鸡肉炒饭！”我希望我能说这是他第一次向我发起晚宴。我做了晚饭，然后我徒劳地试图在Arch的卧室里学习，而他和他的朋友们整晚都在玩桌面游戏。有一次，我发现自己躺在他卧室的脏地毯上，盯着参差不齐的天花板，想知道我的生活在做什么。我想，这不像其他人想要我。此外，阿奇不可能照顾好自己。他需要我留下来。我弯曲了右手。GO一个月后，我在咖啡馆遇到了经营我化学实验室的女孩。“嘿！”她说。“当你不知道答案的时候，你就是那个在试卷上画小猫的人。”“是的，”我承认，有点尴尬。“我这样做是为了年级学生，因为我感觉很糟糕。”“好吧，”她说，“那就是我。所以谢谢你的涂鸦。我期待着它们！”然后她清了清嗓子说，“这并不是说你应该把它当作鼓励你考得更好。”苏和我相处得出奇地好，我们经常见面喝咖啡。有一次她问我：“这个新衣橱怎么了？”。“你肯定剪了头发。有新人吗？”“没有。”我笑了笑。“刚刚把旧的那本扔掉了，仅此而已。”在我们一次漫无边际的长谈中，我透露我从未看过《哈利·波特与火焰杯》，因为我太喜欢这本书了，担心这部电影会毁了它。所以她邀请我在那个周末去她家。“我们正在为一个朋友庆祝生日，”她说。“他是个书呆子，所以这是以哈利波特为主题的。我们将在背景中进行电影马拉松比赛。”她用胳膊肘划过桌子。“你想来吗？”“我不认识那个人，这不是很奇怪吗？”我抗议道。一对一的互动很好，但更多的人真的吸引了我。“哦，没事的，”她说。“我会去的。”我张开嘴拒绝，但还没来得及说出这些话，我的眼睛就掉到了右前臂上。抓痕几周前就好了，但我的印象仍然新鲜。“好的，”我说，有点紧张。“我会去的。”马特成功地为自己的论文辩护，并获得了博士学位。我为他感到骄傲，也很紧张。“亲爱的，”马特回到我们的公寓时说。“嗯。”我从电脑上抬起头来，在那里我正在申请该地区的工作。“怎么了？”“我明白了，”他说。“加州大学欧文分校的博士后。他们想要我。”我的心一跳。“这里的大学怎么样？”我说。“格罗斯曼医生说了什么？”马特看了看他的脚。“他嗯，还没有说。但欧文大学的PI听起来对我的研究想法非常兴奋。我将在秋天开始。”他深吸一口气，看着我的眼睛。“我知道这是一个重大举措。但我……我不能拒绝。与这位教授合作一直是……自从我开始走上这条路以来，这一直是我的梦想。”我颤抖着自己。“那你为什么看起来这么沮丧？”我说，强迫自己变得爽朗起来。“太棒了！恭喜你，宝贝。”马特的脸涨红了。“我知道你不想离开这个地区，”他说。“你的家人和朋友都在这里。但我不想在没有你的情况下做这件事。”我的胸脯绷紧了。加利福尼亚州遍布全国。我的右臂刺痛了。我站起来用胳膊搂住他。“你不必，”我说。“我们走吧。”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 352, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "从20层楼的高空坠落并不是你想象的那样。当我站在窗台上看着天际线，喘着粗气，拼命地提醒自己是我的痛苦和厄运驱使我走到这一步时，我发现自己没有品味到生命最后时刻的美，甚至没有全景式地回想起我可怜的存在。我所能想到的就是，当我的身体撞到下面的人行道上时，我是否会听到飞溅的声音。我想象着我的头被打桩到混凝土中，像一个被投掷的番茄一样爆炸，我的躯干像弹片一样从我的皮肤中射出，我的骨头碎成尖锐的小碎片，我的身体也碎了。我能在脑海中看到一滩停滞的血腥，几乎能尝到空气中我自己鲜血的铜色味道，行人围着我那面目全非的尸体围成一圈，司机们减速到橡胶脖子。我开始问自己——这值得吗？当然，我的生活很糟糕，但没有比半个该死的国家更糟糕的了。有单身母亲为了养活孩子而嫖娼，有退伍军人在阿富汗看到自己所有的朋友被炸成碎片后用手枪开枪自杀，我无法忘记非洲所有贫穷饥饿的孩子，他们四肢扭曲，腹部不自然地膨胀，因为他们微不足道的食物、树皮和草慢慢地导致他们营养不良。当我这样想的时候，我意识到我的处境并没有那么糟糕。我有工作，有网络，还有大麻。我的最后一个女孩用她工作中的西装骗了我，这就是我一生都不值得生活的借口，但当我站在边缘颤抖时，一阵凉风吹过我的脸颊，我意识到这一切是多么愚蠢。那么，如果某个女人对我耍花招呢？这不是世界末日，当然也不是我生命的终结，就像我的老人曾经说过的那样，女性就像汽车零件，如果它们坏了，你总是可以更换我，尽管如果零件是异国情调的，你可能不得不从海外订购。我妈妈分手后，他从菲律宾邮购了一份，他当然更高兴了。因此，正是有了新的生命和新的希望感，我才后退了一步，继续我的生活。我没有想到的是我右边的鞋带被解开了。具有讽刺意味的是，原来是鞋带松脱导致了我的松脱。下降和飞溅发生得太快了，我甚至没有时间记录细节。有几秒钟，除了黑暗和对自己尴尬的自我意识，什么都没有，就像我漂浮在某种胚胎外壳中，等待着重生到死后。我太震惊了，没想到会有什么特别的事情发生。我从不信教，尽管我抽的大麻比任何拉斯塔法里教徒都多。所以，当我睁开眼睛，没有发现自己在地下室坐在鲍勃·马利旁边的豆袋上时，我知道我不在天堂。我坐在一把不舒服的低靠背椅子上，这是另外五把椅子上的一个烦人的东西，中间没有扶手。坐在左边的是一位身材魁梧的女士，她有着卷曲的红色头发，脸上长满了粉刺，穿着一件粉色t恤，前面有一只猫的水钻图案。右边坐着一套西装，轻拍着一台笔记本电脑。屏幕上一片空白，但他目不转睛地盯着屏幕看。阳光从天花板上的窗户倾泻而下，反射到临床白色的室内。就在我的正前方是一组通往第二层的自动扶梯，右边是一系列展示各种奢侈品的橱窗，左边是一组展位，容纳着一排又一排的人，他们在现场不舒服地拖着脚，无聊而沮丧地环顾四周。我花了一秒钟的时间才将脑海中逐渐增长的熟悉感与周围环境联系起来。我推了推西装，他咕哝着表示感谢，目光没有从笔记本电脑移开。“嘿，伙计，我们坐在洛杉矶国际机场吗？”“是的，这就是它看起来的样子。”。“你可能会认为我疯了，但不久前，我的头骨在去斯普拉茨维尔的单程旅行中。”“嗯，我把车撞到了一辆轿车的侧面，杀死了一家四口。”这让我很困惑。他听起来像是在讽刺，但我不能确定。就目前的情况来看，我完全没有能力了解情况。“我不小心喝了我小猫的耳朵药，把自己毒死了，”这位女士探过身来插话道。她从口袋里掏出一些东西，递给我一袋皱巴巴的M女士。“你想要一些吗？很有趣，我没想到食物能送到另一边，但这个小袋子确实做到了，最棒的是它永远不会用完！我已经吃了三天了，它仍然很满！”涂层我惊讶地发现它的味道几乎一样。我有点以为它会在我嘴里变成灰烬或灰尘。“所以……我猜这是来生？”西装咕哝着，钥匙的咔嗒声瞬间变慢了。“看起来就是这样。”。“是的，也不完全是我所期望的……”西装举起一只手，指着离我们那排座位最近的摊位，那里的队伍移动得最快。“你得去那边排队。”“是的，你得抢张票！”她拿出一个白色的存根，上面用像素墨水印着“97982”。“为什么？”“哦，我不知道，我只是跟着其他人。那位好心的女士说，当我的号码被呼叫时，我会转到下一个级别或类似的级别，我希望里面全是小猫！”西装保持沉默，他充满活力地拍了拍。我耸耸肩，加入了队伍，回头看到那个女人再次攻击她的M M，西装继续快速地击键。我站在一个穿着过时哥特风格的孩子身后，他对我的提示不屑一顾。我所能做的就是等待，惊叹于一切是多么平凡。我一生中只去过洛杉矶国际机场一次，那是在我妈妈离家出走后，我和老人从凤凰城搬到加利福尼亚州的时候。那里挤满了人，声音比我在亚利桑那州长大时看到的任何声音都大。相比之下，我到达的迭代是无精打采和迟缓的，一群人尴尬地在排队或座位区闲逛，甚至没有偷看一眼。当我拖着队伍前行时，我想，死亡已经消除了死亡的烦恼。很快，我就站在最前面，低头看着一个穿着深红色制服的女孩。她有点像空姐，金色的头发扎成一个紧发髻，阳光灿烂的笑容露出一排闪亮的白色牙齿。我几乎没有注意到她眉毛上突出的两个角，也没有注意到她的虹膜不自然的颜色，红色与她的制服相匹配。“你好，先生，欢迎来到地狱-X，你来到永恒的第一站。死亡的方式？”“啊……我似乎记得从楼上摔下来了……”“意外还是自我激励？”。突然间，她的笑容变得更加尖锐和露齿，她那令人愉快的举止变得更加做作和掠夺。当我的困惑状态与一种非理性的担忧相冲突时，我抑制住了颤抖。“你会在适当的时候发现的，先生。如果你能给我一点时间处理你的旅行证件……”她画了一个正面贴着白色标签的马尼拉文件夹。仔细一看，我就能认出印在标签上的我的名字和年龄。她打开文件夹，拿出一张纸条，上面写着我的照片和个人信息，她扫描了一下，然后拿出一个橡皮图章，重重地盖在我的照片上。当她举起邮票时，我可以看到留下的图案——红色大字体的“SUICIDE”。她点击手指，一张票根出现在我手里。我没有质疑它背后的物理原理——我认为规则在地狱里是不同的——我低头看了看数字，用的是和猫女的存根一样的像素化墨水。“对不起，这个数字是什么意思？”她双手合十放在腿上，再次对我微笑。“那是你排队的地方，先生。请回到座位上，等待你的电话号码。”“你是在告诉我……前面有……一百万九千八百二十六个人？”“没错，先生。我知道你与人行道的不幸相遇并没有影响你的算术能力！干得好！”我试图反驳，但她饥饿的眼神让我犹豫了。“所以我自杀了，我个人的地狱就是排队等了一辈子……太好了……”她微微倾斜着头，示意我回到座位上。“欢迎你来生，先生。”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 380, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "“那顿饭太棒了，乔希，”玛丽棕色的眼睛闪烁着可能性和兴奋，乔希能明显感觉到。他报以微笑。他只是想让事情运转起来，这是他一生中的第一次。到目前为止，他们进展顺利，因为玛丽15分钟前才到乔希家吃饭，没有太多时间把事情搞砸，甚至对乔希来说也是如此。天哪，他是不是不假思索地提出了这个建议。在玛丽到达之前，乔希已经设法打碎了七个盘子，因为盘子真的很滑，而且他没有The New Fabulous Smart Grip PlatesTM。他洒了两杯果汁，是因为他没有婴儿防溢吸管杯TM，还是，等等，是因为没有EZ倾倒漏斗，果汁版TM？有时很难确定。他甚至无法收拾残局，因为他已经没有Oxi clean了，他把他的ShamWow借给了一个朋友。几次厨房小火灾后，他在桌子上等着吃晚饭。由于玛丽迟到得很时髦，她没有看到乔希的羞辱性笨拙。然而“……太糟糕了，我吃不完！我太饱了。你能不能帮我把这个放在冰箱里，我回家后再拿？”“哦。当然。”乔希的手上布满了多年来用削皮刀和土豆削皮器意外留下的褪色疤痕，微微颤抖。他成功地把玛丽的盘子扫了起来，带到厨房，没有掉下来，也没有倾翻。他集中精力把盘子放下，面部肌肉痛苦地抽搐着。成功看了那么多小时的服务员和酒店培训视频终于开始有了回报。做盘子。好吧，现在他所要做的就是从橱柜里拿出一个特百惠容器，打开盖子，把食物放进容器里，换上盖子，把剩菜放进冰箱。他觉得自己的呼吸变得有点急促，于是努力用鼻子控制住。好吧打开橱柜。他像一个经验丰富的专业人士一样用手搂住把手，自言自语地笑了笑。即使没有Man Handle DeluxeTM，Josh也成功地“处理”了它。他打开了橱柜，还没来得及做出反应，一大堆特百惠就砸在了他的脸上。被倒下的特百惠包围着，乔希感到很失落。客观地说，他知道这没什么大不了的，玛丽根本不会在乎，但这打破了僵局，这是一长串失误和失败中的第一个，最终让他失去了所有的关系。第三次热可可洒在别人腿上，第五次差点被通用品牌的非SnuggieTM可穿戴毯子勒死，第二次用电击项圈杀死了一只心爱的狗，但没有得到Sparky的认可，他不能责怪别人放弃了他。人们可能会想，如果这些产品能让乔希的生活变得更轻松，他为什么不拥有这些产品。如果他们能把他日常生活中隐喻性的“叠加红色X的黑白滤镜”变成一个彩色天堂，在那里不会发生任何坏事。首先，他就是没钱。即使该产品的实际零售价值为150，也不意味着他能负担得起19.95的两笔轻松付款。此外，每个频道都有这么多电视广告，他该如何跟上所有这些广告？最后，他必须保持一些表面上的尊严——很多这样的产品，比如Tupper TowerTM，都是胡说八道，在他买这样一个愚蠢的装置之前，他会让自己淹没在一百万吨掉落的Tupperware下面。“啊，哇，”乔希转过身来面对玛丽，但看起来玛丽从来没有跟着他进过厨房。“乔希！这太尴尬了，你能帮帮我吗？”他听到她从大厅里传来的声音。当他走下大厅时（一路上被地板隔板绊倒，头撞在壁灯上），他看到玛丽的头从浴室门里探出来，闻到了明显的大便味。玛丽剧烈地左右摇头，这看起来很有趣，因为它似乎在门旁脱离了实体。“我很抱歉，乔希，我想我堵住了你的厕所，我试着用你的柱塞，但它不起作用，”玛丽的言语腹泻在紧张的咆哮中溢出。“别担心，我会看看我能做些什么！”乔希笑着进去查看损坏情况。这真是太可怕了——大便难以置信地溅得到处都是，甚至在淋浴间的墙上，看起来也莫名其妙地溅到了浴帘后面。“不，不，这是我的烂摊子。如果我能的话，我相信我能解决它——”玛丽在乔希面前侧身，当她从地板上取回湿透的柱塞时，仔细看了他一眼她的屁股。该死还不错。她的紧身睡衣JeggingsTM真的展示了她完美成形、柔软的屁股。她拿起柱塞，开始往厕所里塞。她的手在柱塞的轴上来回移动，她试着打开马桶，但都无济于事。她跪下，将柱塞放在不同的位置，当她卡住并将其撕开时，会发出抽吸声。她摇晃着，用空闲的手摸索着马桶水箱的把手。乔希觉得自己变得可耻地直立起来，皮肤涨红了，这是这里唯一的脸红的东西。是因为玛丽对厕所做出了淫荡的举动，还是他终于找到了另一个和自己一样的人，这让他很兴奋？玛丽气喘吁吁地吐出一缕汗流浃背的头发。她对乔希报以和解的半笑。“这件事发生在你身上了吗？”乔希大吃一惊。他以前在什么地方听到过这个表情，但他就是记不起在哪里。他结结巴巴，舌头干涩，试图克服这种怀疑。不相信什么，他不确定。玛丽向他走了一步，也许从他的眼睛里看到了什么，一种纯粹的情感，一颗心在他的袖子上。她不知不觉地向前挪了挪头。他移动了他的。他们慢慢地发现彼此的嘴唇，舌头温暖地混合在一起，这是他们周围潮湿的jenkem气味的一种很好的感官缓解。与此同时，水槽漏水，浴帘杆掉了下来。“是的，这件事发生在我身上，”乔希轻声说道。这是他可以放心地说的，因为这种完全相同的情况确实以这种方式发生在他身上，除了灼热的肉感，还有上次柱塞手柄卡在淋浴杆的中空端。现在还没有发生。然而他确信他们会一起找到实现这一目标的方法。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 381, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "普莱普看着人影跌跌撞撞地走在尘土飞扬的小路上。他或她看起来像是在躲避袭击，同时按照一个错误的两步舞跳舞。普莱普忍不住笑了起来，这一定是鲁斯蒂·马雷的一位顾客在早上摇摇晃晃地回家。当人影疯狂地旋转时，普莱普从浓密的白胡子中猜到这是一个男人。他的小腿、大腿和前臂上都穿着深色皮革，虽然质量更好，但与普莱普的很相似。正是胸甲引起了他的兴趣。它全身黑得像沥青，但有一种奇怪的光芒，看起来像是吞噬了阳光。这名男子放弃了跳舞，改为仰卧。普莱普小心翼翼地走近。鸟儿们还在叽叽喳喳，这总是一个好兆头，他的老骡子莱萨看起来很无聊。当他在几步的范围内时，他问陌生人是否没事。当没有人回应时，他大声喊道。他希望没有人在看，他觉得对着一具可能的尸体大喊大叫很傻。普莱普仍然没有回应，用脚轻推了他一下。他听到一声呻吟，又用一种可以形容为踢的方式推了他一下。“把这个……从我身上拿开，”老人沙哑地说。普莱普卸下了他身边的夹子，但当他试图卸下肩膀时，盔甲拒绝移动。“你……接受吗？”老人喃喃自语，眼睛疯狂地旋转。“你必须……杀死……恶魔，瞧……”？普莱普说，他接受了，当他把这名男子抬到一个可以卸下盔甲的位置时，盔甲自行解开。他脱下盔甲，再次将这名男子放倒。等等，那是关于恶魔的什么？“离开他，他会好起来的，”他双手中传来一个声音，“让我上场，还有很多事情要做。”普莱普不得不承认，地上的那个人看起来确实健康了很多，年轻了一点，可能只是需要好好睡个午觉。诚然，会说话的盔甲有点奇怪，但他一生中最精彩的对话之一是与一个喝醉的王座。他拿起盔甲穿上。普莱普很惊讶这件盔甲的合身程度，认为它太大了。普莱普感觉很好，很强壮，视力也有所提高，他确信自己是一名剑术大师，尽管他一生中从未打过剑。他走到老莱萨面前，对她说了一些非常激烈的话，告诉她她是一匹年轻的种马，可以一次驰骋数英里而不累。莱萨确实觉得自己是一匹小种马，不幸的是，她是一只年轻的种牛，对马从人类驯化中解放出来有一些非常强烈的观点。她转过身来，一脚踢在他的胸口。盔甲承受了打击，但他的感情没有那么强烈。莱萨绕了一圈，试图咬他裸露的手臂。“你必须打断她，她将成为你的战马，”盔甲说。普莱普想回答说，他没有与马或认为它们是马的骡子搏斗的经验，但他不需要这样做，因为当他不看的时候，他的脚已经跳了起来。他仰面着地，双脚着地，找到平衡，把莱莎推到正确的方向。旅途并没有那么糟糕，他至少以壮观的方式到达了一个小镇。当他正要搜寻食物时，一个小女孩跑到他面前，大喊她的家人需要帮助。普莱普百分之六十七确信他回答说那不是他的工作，她最好问问警卫，或者看看，或者这里叫什么，她知道他在哪里可以买到好的食物吗。但甚至在他闭上嘴之前，他就全速跑到女孩身后，不知怎么地追不上她，尽管她只有他的一半大。它们在屋后、甚至一度在屋顶上扭来扭去。他们惊动了接吻的情侣和熟睡的乞丐。最后，普莱普来到一条小巷，越走越窄。他看着女孩从小巷尽头的一扇门里消失了，同时在奔跑中喘着粗气。“你需要一把剑，”盔甲说，“可能还需要一些火。”“真的很有用，谢谢会说话的盔甲！”普莱普屏住呼吸说，“就像剑不知从哪里冒出来一样！”普莱p看了看左边，发现了一个只能是剑柄的东西，立刻觉得很傻。他一定知道这是一个柄，因为当他往下看时，他看到了剑的部分。他抓起它，嘴里嘟囔着一些不该说话的刻薄话，挤进小巷，头朝下穿过门。在一次巧妙的翻转后，他双脚着地，用力将剑向上挥舞，听到剑划过一个肉嘟嘟的东西，然后在他耳边发出震耳欲聋的尖叫声。剑自动地舞动着，请拿起一把乐器和它的延伸部分。他仍然对这些生物的尖叫充耳不闻，眼泪从他的眼睛里飞了出来，所以他闭上了眼睛，而剑杀死了向他飞来的任何东西。这种情况持续了几分钟，数十具尸体砰的一声倒在地上。“你可以睁开眼睛了，普莱普，”盔甲温柔地说，“一切都结束了。”普莱普仍在哭泣。这把剑在他身边的一个伤口上套了起来，他不记得自己得到了这个伤口。一道柔和的白光照亮了他周围的一小部分黑暗，他希望盔甲能阻止它，因为他能看到被毁坏和损毁的尸体。“只有吸血鬼，普莱普，愚蠢的吸血鬼！他们不是人，”盔甲说，“前面有宝藏，你想去看看吗？可能是值得带的东西，也许是一顶漂亮的头盔？你喜欢吗，普莱普？”普莱普不愿意承认，但有些宝藏会很好。他擦了擦眼睛和鼻子，又愤怒地嗅了嗅，然后让盔甲引导他穿过午夜的群山。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 389, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "泽尔达盯着他的全息监视器，从控制台上看着我，他的四只眼睛在向我眨眼。我们坐在指挥舱的密闭空间里，乘坐我们的星际侦察船Drix'ridia。吊舱里充满了来自我们各种面板、监视器和全息图显示器的半透明全息光。从他苍白的灰色皮肤上的怒容，我能感觉到他相当严肃。“我们正在接近太阳系的主行星。”他按下全息按钮，防护隔热罩在我们的指挥舱上方滑开，揭示了太空的黑暗。当一个巨大的灰色球体突然出现在我们头顶时，我屏住了呼吸。泽尔达点了点头。“这是主星上唯一的月亮，我们应该用两个眼镜来清理它的黑暗面。”我摇摇头，从控制台上向后靠，眼睛刺痛。在过去的1800年里，我一直在观看来自地球的传输，我很累，几乎筋疲力尽。起初，当我被佐拉县最高司令部召集来帮助执行侦察任务时，我似乎很兴奋。和佐拉仙太空舰队的大多数年轻军官一样，我的兴奋之情溢于言表。这就是为什么我们都加入进来，探索未知，跨越恒星与外星物种见面。太阳系的戏剧性和传播是众所周知的。80多年来，他们一直在生产低兆瓦的能量传输，佐拉县最高指挥部知道很快就到了进行初步接触的时候了。你可以想象，当我和泽尔达从数千名佐拉仙舰队候选人中被选中时，我的震惊。在我的职业生涯中，我从未如此自豪过。当然要付出代价。这意味着要穿越基托斯地区，穿越16光年，与一个潜在的落后或危险的外星社会互动。我非常激动，并尽我所能履行了我的职责。我梦想着最初的接触会是什么，我们会发现什么秘密。这一切让我感觉自己又像个孩子了。我对跨越浩瀚的太空并与这些物种进行一些有意义的接触的想法感到敬畏。这不仅是我舰队生涯的亮点，也是我作为一名军官和佐拉县公民一生中的最高成就。我将创造历史，弥合16光年宽的鸿沟。它可能会改变一切。。。。。永远这种兴奋就像某种无限的动力源一样激励着我。在我的训练中，在我们的长途旅行中。就在我们从太阳系以外的远程巡洋舰上部署的时候。这种兴奋使我走了这么远。。。。。。。直到我们到达太阳系并开始接收来自主行星的传输。我研究了一下，恐惧减轻了。即使在1800 Pectars之后，我也很少对Zerda说什么。我再次仔细检查了我的翻译设置，肯定出了问题，但这是我第十次在我们的计算机翻译系统中没有发现错误。我看到的图片和视频都是正确的，我在座位上发抖。我把它们编目并记录下来，但我已经清楚地知道我在看什么了。这是野蛮。“怎么了？”泽尔达问道，注意到我的颅骨触须在扭动，这是佐拉仙不舒服的迹象。“地球人……是……”我屏住呼吸。“什么？佩多斯是什么？”泽尔达问我，他的两只眼睛盯着我，另两只眼睛则盯着导航系统。“他们有防御性的轨道恒星战斗机吗？他们打算拦截吗？告诉他们我们很和平”，他皱着眉头说。“不，他们可能……地球人比我们被告知的要危险得多。”我结结巴巴地说。“你是什么意思？”他问道，他的四只眼睛现在盯着我。“我们最初的报道是不正确的。他们不是一个处于星际旅行泽尔达尖端的和平文明。”我直截了当地说。我叹了一口气，看到他的颅骨触须从他头部侧面的角囊中露出。“解释一下佩多斯。”他用命令的语气说。“我已经详细研究了这些地球传输，并得出了一个合乎逻辑的结论，即我们正处于严重的危险之中。”当我们穿过月球的黑暗面时，当我们的Zitranium发动机呼啸而过时，沉默了片刻。在我们头顶上，我们看到一个巨大的蓝色球体充满了黑暗的太空。地球庄严地俯视着我们，蓝色的海洋和白色的云层。泽达检查了传感器。“电磁频谱上有多个传输。他们可能在扫描我们。我们该怎么办？”“我们立即转身，中止任务。也许建议进行行星卫生。”我反驳道。“为什么？根据最初的射电望远镜扫描，他们已经掌握了能量传输。”。“我不是偶然发现基托斯地区失败的。”“我告诉过你，我们正处于迫在眉睫的危险之中。地球人是极其危险的。他们不关心自己。他们互相监禁和隔离。他们犯下罪行和彼此之间的战争。他们在战争中极为先进。他们彼此野蛮，利用监狱、酷刑、囤积食物和资源。他们甚至不共享地球资源。他们充满了心胸狭窄的仇恨，而且不是少数。广大的泽尔达。”“野蛮人。”泽尔达将注意力转向我们的武器系统时说道。“我正在给我们的光子携带枪和能量盾牌通电。我们会保护自己的！”红色警报开始闪烁，我们都看到了来自地球轨道的高能爆发。泽尔达的触手吸回到了他的头上。‘在电网034标记78处检测到高输出传输。我正在隔离焦点。“一个展示突然显示了一个围绕地球运行的叉子形状的金属建筑，我们倒吸了一口凉气。它似乎是高轨道上的一个军事站。我看着泽尔达。”他们可能正在为一种能量武器充电。或者它可能是一个传输。“我说，看着这座奇怪的建筑漂浮在地球上空。泽尔达把四只眼睛转向我。”这可能是为了交流。“我回到控制台，开始隔离原始的无线电频率。我打开音频，我们听到一个噼啪声，然后是一个用原始语言说话的外星声音。我启动了语音翻译，突然我们可以听到它们了。”这是国际空间站。向从月球黑暗面驶来的未知船只致敬。我们无意伤害你。你能表明身份吗？“信息开始重复，我关掉了音频。泽达关切地看着我。”我们应该回复吗？我们有机会进行初步接触。”“不，泽达。我们不会。”我大胆地说。“我们不能。”“为什么不呢？我们在传播范围内，我们可以与他们取得联系！”他愤怒地说，“不，我研究过地球上的变速器。他们擅长的一件事就是欺骗。毫无疑问，他们正在准备摧毁我们的轨道防御系统。或者更糟的是，将我们捕获进行外科实验。”“泽尔达明白这一点，如果他们互相施暴，他们对我们也不会好到哪里去。在我对地球广播的研究中，我学到了很多。他们是战争贩子。他们让孩子们挨饿，擅长屠杀。泽尔达似乎点了点头。“我明白了。”。走了这么远才意识到这一点，这似乎是一种耻辱。也许我们应该向我们的地球邻居传递一个信息。我们不能被轻视。“我点了点头。”同意。让我们发送一个传输到此。。。。。国际空间站。让他们知道，我们也熟悉战争，不会容忍来自如此落后和可悲种族的敌人威胁。瞄准这个所谓的国际空间站。“肯定”泽尔达说，他用触手状的手指启动武器系统。“锁定在主要的超级结构中。”。“我们听到Zitranium电池为我们的前向能量载体提供动力，我嘲笑道。”他们不想通过交流来提升自己或分享科学。他们没有走上启蒙的道路。他们是怪物，寄生虫。我们将用他们唯一能理解的语言与他们交流。“泽尔达点了点头，在一道亮绿色的闪光中，我们发送了他们唯一能理解的信息。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 395, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "我已经进行了第四次巡回演出，看起来第五次巡回演出即将到来。我在基地休息了一周，突然附近响起了爆炸声。预计敌方战斗人员会随机发动袭击，他们会偷偷溜回前线，通常会在被抓住或杀死之前，在沟里努力造成尽可能多的破坏。第二次爆炸？这一次更近了，不是他们自制炸药的正常声音。现在警报响起。我抓起步枪和附近的防护装备。走出去证实了我的担忧，因为士兵们正在尽可能放松地奋力防守，而敌方士兵则迅速靠近。我和他们一起冲向一个临时的补给卡车和集装箱周围。面部保护是标准问题，当敌人看到步枪后面有一群长着相同面孔的士兵时，我们会有一定的恐惧感。我特别注意到一个士兵一直朝我的方向看。我检查了一下我抓了什么盔甲，确保有什么东西没有奇怪地挂起来，但我不再像其他人那样半裸着。我不明白，他应该在监视敌人。通过空中打击的通信喊出命令。H区4 2 8区，方位163。妈的，这会让它超出我们的致命范围。敌人不可能离得那么近，只能看到一小排士兵。当理性思考的时间结束，我们与敌人交火时，枪战爆发了。这个喷气式飞机的尖叫声从远处传来。随着发动机的进步，当它们从头顶飞过时，飞机已经远远看不见了，然后它们的有效载荷在离地面100米的地方引爆，二次装药向各个方向散开。震耳欲聋的爆炸爆米花声响起，我被狠狠地甩了回去。我被灰尘弄得失明，耳朵嗡嗡作响，我发誓那个士兵跑过来站在我身边，步枪燃烧着，肩膀上有一个看起来很严重的伤口，很可能是弹片造成的。他把我拉到掩护处，而我清醒了头脑，和他一起在地上挤了过去。伴随着其他爆炸的枪声仍然是遥远的，经验告诉我，它们并不像听起来那么遥远。“我是你孩子想象中的朋友，我被派来这里是为了在你最需要的时候帮助你。把我拉到安全地带的士兵是唯一一个靠近我的人，它必须向他袭来，但这没有道理，他是一个和我一样的士兵，只是级别较低。我几乎记不清喷气式飞机再次通过时发出的尖叫声。在我意识到发生了什么之前，我被扔到了地上，他跳到了我身上。这次爆炸离得太近了，那些混蛋把炸弹叫到了我们身上。当小型杀伤人员炸弹到处噼啪作响时，冲击波在各种感觉上嘎嘎作响。我敢肯定，我的一个耳鼓破裂了，另一个永远听不到同样的声音，因为我把士兵的尸体从我身上推开，他的面部保护装置也掉了下来。当我拼命想理清思绪时，他脸上熟悉的东西让我有一刻僵住了。现在一切都很安静，因为我的腿不让我站起来。我四处寻找他的身份，任何愿意为指挥官献出生命的士兵都不会闻所未闻，我会确保他的家人得到照顾。我的手上只剩下一张照片，感觉就像第三颗炸弹正好落在我的头上，当我与我第一次旅行那天妻子、孩子和我自己的照片相匹配时，我几乎无法控制自己的颤抖。照片中我的女儿才一岁，我就在那里，就像那个抱着她救了我一命的士兵一样，现在是一具没有生命的尸体，死眼睛凝视着空旷的天空。当医护人员和增援部队进入时，我的视野开始旋转，我摔倒了。当医护人员注意到这张照片后看着我的眼睛时，我感觉自己被抬上担架，然后被抬走了。“你受伤了，但我们会送你回家的！”", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 401, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "在我的最后时刻，当我躺在这里，等待不可避免的寒冷最终消除我的痛苦时，我只能回想我的行为，他们以前都很开心，和圣玛丽小学七班的孩子们一起进行时间旅行冒险。我从来没有意识到会是这样，我所想的只是进行盛大的冒险，教孩子们一点历史。其中一个孩子建议一年，我们就出发了，穿上我神奇的时间旅行靴，准备“激发我们的想象力！”就像我常说的，回到我还是我的时候，回到我微笑的时候。回到2066年，他们坚持认为这是一个非常重要的时期，只比他们现在的时期早了50年。我当时没有认为发生了任何真正重要的事情，当然，作为一个好的第五维度的人，我看到了整个世界在几分钟内崩溃，至少对我来说，所以谁知道呢，我可能错过了一些重要的事件，或者对孩子们有文化意义的事情。借口。我应该问更多的问题，应该意识到。我想，现在想知道还为时不晚。15岁的孩子，还是个孩子，和我几千年的生活相比，他们几乎没有卵子。我想是这种想法把我弄得一团糟。我想，对当地文化的研究还不够。毕竟，我怎么知道在我到达之前的几周里，科幻频道一直在播放不间断的时间旅行电影，或者孩子们，至少是我真正应该更担心的少数人，一直在获得各种各样的想法，这些想法会让大多数对时间流持良好健康谨慎态度的人哭泣。”从孩子们的嘴里说，这是我在这个世界上短暂的时间里遇到的一句话，我的意思与我认为的完全不同。孩子们，纯洁，他们的思想不受贪婪的影响，不受骄傲的保护，对大多数“人类的罪恶”一无所知。他们应该是好的。他们不是。他们有主意。坏主意。他们想变得富有、出名，他们想要一切。只是，还没有。如果你不想伤害自己，或者做好充分准备，那么在时间旅行、过去旅行时，有一些规则需要遵守。你知道自己在哪里，知道自己会做什么。如果这是你的过去和未来，就会有一种与自己互动的方式，一种改变某些事情的方式。这是非常痛苦的。对我来说，每一个第五维度都在这个区域，随着时间的推移，试图改变正在发生的事情，所有多余的能量都必须通过一些管道。如果你在过去旅行，那没关系，受影响的“你”与你可能看到的“你“是分开的，这意味着你在旅行地区的时间只会受到以你自己为中心的影响，而不是以“现在”或你最初所处的时间段作为受影响作品的起点，并且只会受到一次影响。一旦你在未来与自己互动，“你”就会被你之前的互动所改变，引起连锁反应，并递归地导致与你互动的“你”一次又一次地改变，变成其他东西。宇宙可以自我愈合，时间是有弹性和弹性的，但想想一块橡胶，甚至是油灰，放在不断变化的存在的研磨刀片上，即使宇宙最终也无法修复整体。还有更多的细节，但这是你现在需要知道的。好吧，他们不会在我出生的地方出版年鉴，哦，孩子们都是白痴，我的意思是，谁偷了别人的靴子？当我躺在这里，死于内心的时间出血，能量真的爆炸了我的静脉，看着老版本的孩子们把他们带走，教他们关于自己的知识，同时改变，告诉他们什么有效，什么无效，我意识到我一定错过了一些非常重要的事情。现在没关系，我会死的，永远不知道斯泰西女士决定挂2116年的日历，而不是2016年的日历。她认为这会有点有趣，让孩子们对时间旅行周感到兴奋。我永远不会知道他们永远不会知道我发生了什么，我永远不会想到他们把所有的工作都归功于一个像天使一样出现的陌生人，并给了他们这份礼物，但在他们到达后不久就消失了，带着一只极易使用的魔法靴，我当然不会意识到我把这些人类置于银河系统治的道路上，事实上，你如何对抗那些可以通过把技术交给自己来将其技术进步数千年的生物，你如何与那些似乎在技术发生之前就知道一切的怪物战斗？只有我会知道真相，被困在我自己愚蠢创造的无尽悖论中，14个孩子，与他们的成人形态联系在一起，以我的血液为通道，创造了一个知识循环。我等着最后的感冒。它从未到来，只是无尽的时间之火的燃烧感，燃烧着我永恒的能量，看着所有的造物在瞬间崩溃和重建，但在瞬间又崩溃了。我躺在这里奄奄一息。我总是躺在这里奄奄一息。拜托，阻止人类。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 402, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "它们几年前就开始出现了。乍一看，它们像蝗虫。我们会看到一个或两个，永远不会大群。它们的迷幻色彩和奇异的鸣叫声给了我们第一个线索，它们不是虫子。这一点，科学家们还没有发现。从来没有，一个也没有。我们可以很容易地看到和听到它们。多次拍摄。但是，他们智胜了所有的球网。智胜所有陷阱。避免了所有的毒药。某种智慧在指引着我们。我们甚至还没有适合它们的物种。我们就是抓不到一个。他们也破坏了东西。不是什么大事。小事。更像是他们在研究和逆向工程。系统地一点一点地拆开机器。尽管它们看起来无害。他们主要靠垃圾。对他们大喊大叫够了，他们就会永远不理他们。他们在学习。每一个都发出不同的声音。一些高音，一些低沉的木材，一些呻吟或砰砰作响。就像板球的叽叽喳喳声是通过“哇”的球拍发出的。对于这样的小虫子，它们发出很大的声音。在黑暗中，它们的声音听起来像汽车喇叭。那些外星人的喇叭声。我们称他们为洛基人。一个星期二，我碰了一个。我在院子里喝柠檬水，柠檬水落在我的手上。我从来没有见过这么近的。我只是不动，不想吓到它。我以前从来没有听说有人真的有这种感觉。洛基看起来像一只胖知了。它是斑驳的荧光色，看起来像一个艺术博览会的纸砝码。或者，一些艺人的眼光。它走过来，用一只虫子的胳膊碰到了我的小拇指。轻轻一拍。然后它后退并观看。坐在那里一分钟后，它发出一声巨大的喇叭声，就像被踩到的袋子管道一样，然后它飞走了。不知道我是否通过了测试。当我说有人碰过我的时候，没有人会相信我。一天过去了，没有了洛基，我几乎忘记了整个磨难。第二天早上，我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。院子看起来像是被复活节彩蛋覆盖着。我现在走到外面，抓了抓眼睛，试图判断我是在看东西还是在做梦。但是，我的院子里覆盖着成千上万的洛基人。我从来没有听说过这么多人聚集在一起。他们都在看着我。他们都完全沉默了。当我向前走的时候，他们似乎为我开辟了一条路。我走到椅子前坐下。他们回来后围着我，都坐在至少几英尺远的地方。所有人都面向我。然后他们都立刻开始按喇叭，起初声音震耳欲聋，就像一个符号落在了我的头上。我痛苦地尖叫着，他们沉默了。然后，他们又开始了。柔和但逐渐变大，直到它们达到我关注它们的水平。他们每个人都发出自己的音符，与其他几个音符同步。我手腕上的那只会鸣叫一声B8，而几英尺外的另两只会按自己的喇叭，然后五只会按，甚至一次按二十只。他们看着我对他们愚蠢的交响乐做出反应。我只能呆呆地坐在那里，因为我希望自己能带上手机。噪音是有规律的。就像钢琴在试着说话。然后我开始辨认单词。你现在能听到吗？什么他们几分钟内什么也没做。这样更好吗？对在我承认他们之后，他们都沉默了。他们似乎花了15分钟来决定下一步该做什么。“请不要停下来，”我告诉他们。对我奇怪的梦感到惊讶。希望我没有醒来？“你真的能听到我说话吗？”他们问道，结束了沉默。“我想是的。”我回答。这次他们有20分钟没有回应。似乎非常仔细地考虑了他们的反应。“你为什么听不见我说话？”会说话的虫子交响乐用他们唱歌的声音问道。“我想我可以给你。”我回应道。在这一点上，我不想等待bug的响应。我进去放松一下，拿了一台录音机。洛基人再次为我开辟了一条道路。他们似乎能够以个人的身份迅速做出反应，而以群体的身份缓慢做出反应。家里的两个洛基人看着我完成任务，端着一杯咖啡走了出去。我又坐了下来，手里拿着一副磁带和一个记事本。洛基交响乐团说：“在我们结束之前，请不要离开我。”。“对不起，我该怎么称呼你？”“你给我起的名字，洛基斯，很好。”15分钟后。“叫我鲍勃”在接下来的几天里，我们与洛基斯进行了慢动作对话。我会做出回应，他们会问一个问题。等等。当我第二天早上五点上床睡觉时，他们似乎很生气。但是，我没有性交，他们同意回来。当我去检查时，我的大部分电子设备和车辆都坏了。所有这些都以洛基特有的有条不紊的方式拆解。我担心他们破坏了一切，但我所有的食物都完好无损，电器也正常工作。信息很明确，我不会去任何地方，也不会和任何人说话。我是洛基斯的囚犯。在玩了几天的回声游戏后，我让他们开始为我写信息。但是，他们无法。除了文盲和行动迟缓之外，他们都很聪明。据我所知，洛基斯是洛基斯个体的蜂巢思维。每一个洛基都比一只虫子还聪明。但是，他们在一起真是太棒了。他们天真而天才的信息在很多层面上都难以理解。当我问“为什么，我？”时，他们只是简单地回答：“为什么不。”他们问我“人类如何作为个体发挥作用？”我回答：“有时我们没有。”他们似乎总是需要几分钟甚至几天的时间才能完成陈述。几周、几个月、几年过去了，我们建立了一个对话。我发现自己和虫子说话越来越老了。他们给我提供食物。甚至招待我。一次给我带一小份虫子。但是，我总是被这种可怕的节奏，复活节彩蛋，噩梦所束缚。涵盖了从哲学到科学、艺术和虫子的每一个主题。工程和数学问题我甚至都无法回答。他们在很多方面都超越了我。不知道他们为什么选择我。我有时想象他们选择我是因为我看起来无害，很容易被孤立。再也没有人开车沿着这条路行驶了，我想他们可能已经挡住了路。而且，我们总是回到我无法回答的问题：“人类如何作为个体发挥作用？为什么只有一个人？为什么人类没有心灵感应？”几年后，我开始怀疑。为什么他们问我为什么只有我一个人？", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 418, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "我爸爸多年来一直在那里工作，但他想尽可能长时间地保持独立。但即使是他也看到，抛开固执不谈，独自一人打理房子变得越来越困难。因此，他计划搬进一间小公寓，这是一个很好的地方，他的其他一些朋友已经退休了。这很好。有朋友在附近可以减轻这所老房子的损失。与此同时，我周末来整理庄园，帮他弄清楚自己做了什么，不想留下什么。这不是一个简单的过程，因为我时不时会找到一些东西，他不得不停止一切给我讲故事。通常情况下，我并不介意。作为一个天生的讲故事者，我父亲有一套我从未完全学会的语言。然而，我哥哥做到了，即使是现在，当他们两个开始讲大话的时候，你也很难找到更好的方式来度过一个安静的下午。如果我姐姐在身边就更好了。她是一个可爱的、易上当受骗的人。再加上她难以抑制的表现力，你就拥有了完美的观众。每当合适的时候，她都会喘息、流泪、大笑，甚至会瞪着斑比的眼睛。我哥哥时不时会在她面前开一个可耻的玩笑，只是为了激怒她脆弱的感情。爸爸事后会骂他，即使他也觉得这很有趣。这是事情的原则，真的。他做了父亲必须做的事，我们这些孩子必须接受这一点。大多数时候，我们相处得很好。尽管我偶尔会和我哥哥打架，并不断威胁要殴打我姐姐的男朋友。爸爸觉得后者很有趣。我姐姐没有，但她对此表达了愤怒的感激之情。不过，她似乎并不感激我们的哥哥给她同样的报价，即使我们都去了同一家健身房训练。我和哥哥有着激烈的竞争，这让我们在学校里臭名昭著。聪明的老师用它来控制我们。那些不那么聪明的人给我们的父母写了措辞谨慎的信。爸爸觉得这也很有趣。”他会说，只要没有人受伤，我们就学会了一些东西，比如如何下次不被抓住。在我们的糖果面前，一个姐姐的两只鞋，如果他也可以的话。她的脸会变成最有趣的颜色。所以，是的，在大多数情况下，一切都很好。但是，尽管有这么多美好的回忆，我再也不想回去了。答案在于我们家里有一个人，到目前为止我还没有提到。我真的不想谈论她，我已经极力明确表示，这不值得讨论，但当我发现一个装着精心书写的便条卡的小信封时，甚至我也忍不住想谈。写着给我的文字的小卡片。信封是一个褪色的旧东西，但当我往里面看时，这些卡片尽管年代久远，但仍然很脆，我忍不住觉得自己不知怎么又回来了。回到过去，回到过去的记忆。并不是所有的都是好的。这就是为什么我很快就把东西装进口袋，在爸爸注意到之前又开始搬满灰尘的盒子。我可能是一个尽职尽责的女儿，但如果这个世界上有一件事是我应得的，那就是他妻子的缓刑。等我去了安全的家后，我会把信封拿出来。只有当我的家人看不到我的时候，我才会冒险。只有四张牌。所有这些基本上都是斯巴达式的设计，她的剧本写得很紧凑，无可挑剔，就像我记忆中的那样简洁而简洁。一个当她死的时候。一个当我结婚的时候。一个当我有孩子的时候。还有一个是当我“像死了一样好”的时候。她的话，不是我的。在我正确阅读这些东西之前，我必须克制住烧掉它们的冲动，即使我的手指在接触时会发痒，心跳也会特别快。她早就走了，在这一点上，她所能做的就是通过这些小纸片来遮荫。要是我没有把她的声音放在脑子里读就好了。第一个是可以预见的苦涩。第二个是残酷的。第三个包含了父母传给孩子的常见诅咒。最后。。。。。我还不知道该如何应对。这确实令人沮丧。与其他三位不同的是，她实际上写的东西足以填满一侧。我可以想象，这一定让她有多恼火，不得不浪费比她想浪费的更多的墨水，尤其是在所有人中的我身上。我希望我能和别人谈谈这件事。和某人谈论过她。我很确定她这么做主要是出于怨恨，但话说回来。。。。。现在想弄清楚她是没有用的。至少，她能够承认，她把我怀疑她的一切都归咎于我。不过，我不确定是否真的值得保留这个有毒的纪念品。老实说，我真的希望他们被摧毁，哪怕只是为了确保她不会再玷污留给我们的美好回忆。。。。。它们是我的家人可能相信的唯一确凿的伤害证据。在好日子里，我自己都不敢相信这些事情会发生。看看我们是如何应对的，很难描述她从我们身上夺走了什么。从表面上看，大多数人不会对我们的家庭三思而后行。我姐姐一直试图和我们从不太认可的男孩约会，总是找一些白马王子或其他人来带走她。只要她未来的伴侣明白他们会对她做正确的事，否则会承担后果，我就尽量不太在乎。我哥哥一直和一群坏人打架，直到我把他拖进拳击场，谢天谢地，他在那里找到了一些东西，可以让他进入一所好学校。只要他保持专注，远离麻烦，我就尽量不妨碍他。还有爸爸。。。。。好吧，我不想再给他戴口罩了，就像妈妈已经戴了一样。我试着让他在当地的避难所、课后团体、社区烧烤和当地体育赛事中帮忙。任何他可以和朋友一起放松、喝杯啤酒、讲故事的地方。我们很清楚：我没有因此而怨恨我爸爸。他做不到，也没有保护我们任何人免受她的伤害。他应该这样做，但如果说有一件事我从记事起就一直在想，那就是当你被爱的时候，我的意思是真的被爱过一次，真的很难忘记。这不是你可以放手的事情。你听说过狗如此忠诚，它们拒绝离开主人的尸体。人们并没有什么不同。我是谁告诉我爸爸他应该离开她？他那时爱她，现在仍然爱她。他太爱她了，他看不到她给我们的伤疤，她给他的伤疤。我想她恨我，因为我是她唯一不能骗的人。恨我，她觉得我在她和她的家人之间。想想都很有趣，因为嘿，她也是我妈妈。我想他们说的关于长子的一些话是真的。我承认，一开始我认为我做的是正确的，让他们有自己的伪装方式。我觉得最好是我们中只有一个人首当其冲。我真的不想讨论意识到最终不仅仅是我爸爸促成了她：我也在促成她。不过我不想给他们看。还没有。也许永远不会。怎么会有“合适的时间”向他们展示这样的东西呢？目前，这些卡被放在银行金库的一个锁着的小盒子里。所以我可以。。。。。我想以后再处理。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 440, "lang": "zh"}
{"text": "现在很难移动。每一次跌倒似乎都需要永恒。肌肉的每一次抽搐都会让我更有活力。无论如何，我都会这样做。窗户在走廊的尽头，我必须看到太阳升起。三十步之外。我曾经有一颗人类的心。我是一个和其他人一样的人。我爱一个叫莎拉的女人。她的嘴唇柔软得像刚摘下的石南花。阳光在她的头发上闪烁着金色的光芒。二十八步。经过长时间的求爱，她同意做我的新娘。我们在一座俯瞰悬崖的小教堂举行了婚礼。大海像碎钻石一样闪闪发光，鸟儿欢快地歌唱。那天，当我握着她的手时，我感觉到我的心跳与她的心跳交织在一起。在这个世界上，我们是两个不完整的人，但通过改变，我们找到了使我们完整的东西。I、 作为一个人，与我们在一起的情况相比，这算不了什么。当时我以为我已经达到了完美的顶峰。幸福的时代。我再也感受不到比这更快乐的了。然而，被证明是错的并没有伤害到我。现在我已经走了二十二步了。她的名字叫Emily，她是我亲爱的Sarah，在重生的同时，她更令人敬畏。这并没有削弱她母亲的美丽和荣耀。相反，即使是接近也比大多数人所希望的要多。我爱他们。我知道我做到了。我因为他们而活。当小埃米莉因为风呼啸或风暴肆虐而无法入睡时，她会爬到我和莎拉之间的床上。我会醒着躺着，听着他们的呼吸稳定下来，并努力使我自己的呼吸与他们的呼吸相匹配。当我知道他们睡着了，我就会抓住他们的手。萨拉的小手在我的左手边，埃米莉的小手在右边。我会让自己平静下来，感觉到它们微弱的脉搏与我的心跳交织在一起。二十步。三年前，世界变成了灰色。我记得以前的颜色，但现在，它们还存在吗？当其他人凝视大海时，他们是否看到了一片永远无法解渴的灰色水沙漠？其他人看到无色的阳光炙烤着我们脚下的土地吗？上面是一片空虚，下面是未兑现的承诺。其他人看到了吗？还是只有我一个人？也许在我接到电话并被告知事故发生的那天，整个世界都失去了色彩。十五步。到一半了。我赶到圣詹姆斯医院。一个灰色的护士站在门外不让我进去，她说他们正在做手术。医生们正在竭尽全力挽救他们的生命。那些灰色的门深深地坐落在一堵更暗的灰色墙的灰色框架内。我无法让护士理解。我的心在里面！正是在那些灰色的灯下，拿着灰色刀子的灰色男子聚集在那里。那是我的心，他们太粗心了！如果我再也没有感觉到他们的心跳，我的心怎么会知道跳动？十二步。莎拉和埃米莉两天后去世。母亲和女儿在一小时内相继去世。我有时认为莎拉先放手，这样她就可以继续前进，在另一边陪伴我们的女儿。牵着她的手，再次把他们的心锁在一起，等待我的手完成这个循环。也许他们还在那里等我。十步。请我必须继续。我的心跳现在更弱了。缓慢缓慢的节拍，几乎没有力气把脚抬离地板。我的脚步现在又慢又停。再打十次，心脏。请这是你欠我的。从那以后，我开始振作起来。我把钥匙用链子系在脖子上。一条属于我妻子的链子。一把属于我女儿的塑料钥匙。每天晚上，就在我要求入睡以结束又一个灰暗的日子之前，我会把钥匙插入他们经过时留下的胸口的洞里。一个我没有去过的车祸刻下的洞。然后我会一遍又一遍地拧钥匙，拉紧自己内心的主发条，提醒我的心如何继续前进。八步。我的左脚感觉好像被钉在地板上了。我再也没有力气举起它了。在绝望中，我推了推。它瞬间抗拒。涂了清漆的木地板似乎阻力太大了。然后，它慢慢地向前移动。我把重心转移到左脚，右脚向前推。灰蒙蒙的一天又一天，我机械般的心在我体内滴答作响。有些日子，天空下起了灰蒙蒙的雨。其他日子，灰色的雪花飘落在我的头上。我动了。我呼吸着。我的心在滴滴答答。我曾经存在过。但我没有活着。我不能。我怎么能？没有心脏，我只是一个模仿人类动作的机器人。直到那个穿着红色连衣裙的女人走进咖啡店。再往前走三步。我可以做到。我的关节都冻僵了，就好像沙子被困在它们的工作中一样。我努力眨眼，眼睑吱吱作响。我的心在滴答作响，但现在更柔软了。每一个滴答声都是它前进的影子。如果我在这里绊倒，我可能会摔倒最后几步，但我需要站直才能透过窗户看到。我叫我的腿把我抬得更远一点。我的脚麻木了，铅染了不再属于我的东西。但我的腿。当然，他们仍然可以服从我的最后要求。我的臀部弯曲，拖着一只无用的脚向前走。两步！咖啡是我灰色世界里为数不多的颜色之一。它仍然是黑色的。我毫无乐趣地喝了它，也没有让我从睡眠的枷锁中解脱出来。我在生活中无所事事，出于以前的习惯，我去了咖啡店。一个色彩依旧，心跳依旧的时代。我正要离开商店时，发现自己几乎失明了。一个女人进来了，她穿着红色的衣服。这是我从灰色的一天开始看到的第一个颜色，因为他们的电话更灰了。这种颜色是怎么来的？只走了一步，我的腿就再也不肯给我了。我的身体被冻住了。我的心几乎要垮了。走了这么远，现在却在我的目标面前失败了。当我看到她时，我第一次感觉到了什么。我想，好奇中夹杂着愤怒。这种颜色怎么敢闯入我的灰色世界？然而，与此同时，我对它感到惊讶。对一个色彩、感觉和生活的世界的怀旧。多年来，我的生活一直有条不紊地进行着。我的双脚每天都在同一条轨道上载着我从工作到回家。多年来，我第一次感到离开这些轨道的冲动。我走到女孩面前自我介绍。我们一起喝咖啡。我把一个陌生的微笑强加在我冰冷的嘴唇上。她笑了，我也假装笑了。她说话，我听着。我尽我所能假装自己不是一个男人的空壳。不知怎么的，我们后来来到了我的公寓。我甚至不知道她的名字。滴答滴答它正在消退。只要再打几下，我的心就完全放松了。从下面我感觉到一种温暖的东西充满了我空洞的身体。这是我多年来从未有过的感觉。这种原始的情感燃烧着我冰冷的外壳几乎忘记的热量。绝望的热度。我的腿不再服从我了。我的手臂不再服从我。我的头几乎不服从。我放手了。我让我的脖子向多年来一直压在它身上的重量低头。我让灰色的世界把我撞倒了。但我现在正向前倒下。我刚刚醒来，想起前一天晚上我忘了给自己的心上发条。我在黎明前冰冷的灰色灯光下在床头柜里摸索着找钥匙。它不见了。那个穿红衣服的女孩也是。我只找到一张等着我的纸条。在新的一天里，我几乎看不清这张纸条。亲爱的保罗，纸条上写着。直到那时我才想到，我也从来没有告诉那个女人我的名字。我很抱歉。我昨晚对你不诚实，现在很难对你诚实。我知道我是个懦夫。我今天趁你还在睡觉的时候走了。但是，我知道，如果有人能理解我现在为什么这么做，那就是你。自从我失去丈夫的那一天起，日子就灰暗了。保罗，你应该很清楚这一天。它在我们两个人身上都留下了印记。两辆车，保罗，三条生命逝去。如果你能给我们五个，我们数吗，保罗？我们是不是幸存者？我爱马克。也许我应该比他更经常地告诉他。他在路上是我的错吗？那天早些时候，我们刚打了一架，他就冲出门去了。对我很生气。我想他自己也很生气。当他的车撞到另一辆车时，他还在生气吗？或者那时他原谅我了吗？我知道这不重要，但重要。他会张开双臂等我吗？还是疼痛仍会把他从我身边赶走？在我知道之前我不能面对他，保罗。我就是不能。当我丢了自己的钥匙时，我第一次感觉到了什么。害怕我害怕面对我那颗缺失的心，却不知道它是丢失了还是抛弃了我。我很自私，我是个懦夫，保罗。我偷了你的钥匙。我知道这是错误的，我两次夺走你的生命。为什么我所做的一切似乎都伤害了你，保罗？我会请求你的原谅，但我不应该得到任何原谅。我会要求你不要因为我诅咒自己而诅咒我。我所要求的是，如果你看到马克，不要告诉他我做了什么。如果这些年对你和对我一样不友善，你会放过我那一点善意吗？亲爱的，六月我的头撞到了窗户玻璃上。我胸口滴答作响。它很快就会失败。与此同时，我看到一个金色的光球从地平线上升起，把田野沐浴在绿色之中，让海水再次起舞。那些在夜里长了很长时间的影子现在正在消退，鸟儿的歌声充满了白天。而且，如果我闭上眼睛集中注意力，我想我能感觉到两只幽灵般的手抓住我自己的手，它们微弱的心跳在寻找我自己的。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 441, "lang": "zh"}

{"text": "“谢尔曼，拿来！”他从来没有听过我的话，即使是在做了13年主人之后的现在，我的狗也很少对我表现出爱意或顺从。可能是因为我在大学认识的一个朋友在他一岁的时候把这个小家伙送给了我。尽管如此，这并没有阻止我向他表达爱意。今天我们在公园呆了一段时间，天气很热，我没有什么可做的。我在商店的夜班很快就开始了，天已经黑了。是时候离开了。我收拾好毯子，抓起背包，谢尔曼喊道，他绝望地看着我，继续做他的事情。这并不是什么新鲜事，正如我所说，他从来不听我的。我走到他身边，在他的带领下，我们沿着穿过公园中心的人行道出发。环形公园在晚上灯火通明，黑暗的蔓延速度比我预期的要快得多，而且很明显有一团轻雾正在袭来，我一定是跑得有点晚了。这并不重要。当我穿过马路走向我的公寓时，我漫不经心地看着周围的雾。天气降得很冷，这在八月的一个晚上是不寻常的。这只是同一次旅行，不同的一天。我发现自己的日常生活开始困扰我，我开始重新考虑一切。我做过的每一个决定，无论我是否快乐，我是否喜欢我成为的那个人，更重要的是，这是否值得改变。看在上帝的份上，我的狗似乎都不爱我，其他人怎么可能呢？我们慢慢地向入口走去，在这里，迈克（保安）会款待谢尔曼，问我今天过得怎么样。但今天，他不在。我耸耸肩，我们朝楼梯走去。我最不想做的事就是两个小时后起床去上班，但我想，当你进入日常生活时，你会变得太自满了，什么也做不了。谢尔曼跑向三楼的楼梯出口，然后像往常一样出现并看着我。我打开门，我们都走了进去。谢尔曼立即朝345号公寓跑去。我的公寓是340，自从我们住在这里以来，谢尔曼一定对布局感到困惑——有时会让人困惑，尤其是当你喝醉的时候。但他知道就在这一层，他不可能认识里面的任何人；保安告诉我，在我逗留期间，这个房间从未出售或使用过。我又一次对自己的日常生活沾沾自喜，耸耸肩，咕哝着“赫尔曼”。谢尔曼立即对我咆哮，直直地盯着我，然后又回到门口。。。。。脖子后面的头发竖了起来，我突然感到肾上腺素飙升，这并不是因为天气很冷。十三年来，我的狗从来没有听过我说话，但那天晚上它听了；因为与345有关。走廊里的空气很冷，我很累。我记得我在想“我会失去什么？”我走到345路，谢尔曼开始在门下咆哮。我听到公寓的门在拐角处砰的一声关上，差点让我心脏病发作。仔细一看门，我发现有划痕。钉子？谁知道呢。从墙上传来的潮湿气味几乎让人难以忍受，但谢尔曼下定决心，我抓住把手扭了扭。它被锁住了。”那个谢尔曼太好了！对不起，小家伙，今天别想知道里面有什么！”我很失望，但最终还是松了一口气。我是一个相当理性的人，但我很害怕。我们绕到拐角处，回到了旧的可靠的340。我的门锁上了，但门闩没有锁，我们被锁在外面了。我漠不关心的自己对此不以为然，因为迈克还有另一把钥匙要给我。我朝楼梯往回走，但当我转过拐角时，我僵住了——345号公寓的门开着。谢尔曼站在我身边，咆哮着，吠叫着，黑色的深渊似乎覆盖着门口，盯着我们……编辑：现在是凌晨2:30，我很高，不知道自己在做什么，如果你想要更多，告诉我。很高兴我终于试了一个。忽略任何错误，因为我显然做到了。", "label": 1, "source": "wp_human", "idx": 448, "lang": "zh"}
