However, its use during pregnancy is generally not recommended because it can potentially affect the development of the fetus.In early pregnancy, progestins like norethisterone can sometimes cause abnormalities, although the risk is considered to be low. The use of progestins in early pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of certain congenital malformations, such as heart defects and limb reduction defects, but these associations are not always consistent in the medical literature.It's important to note that many pregnancies where progestins have been inadvertently used do result in healthy babies. The fact that you took Primolut N before knowing you were pregnant does not necessarily mean there will be an adverse effect on your baby. However, it is crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.Your doctor will likely want to monitor your pregnancy closely, especially during the early stages, to ensure that the baby's development is progressing normally.

Pacemakers are electronic devices that are designed to regulate the heartbeat, and they are sensitive to magnetic fields. The effect of a magnet on a pacemaker depends on several factors, including the strength of the magnet, the duration of exposure, and the specific type of pacemaker.Most modern pacemakers have a feature called magnet mode, which is activated when a magnet is placed over the device. In magnet mode, the pacemaker operates in a fixed-rate mode, meaning it paces the heart at a predetermined rate regardless of the body's actual need for pacing. This is a safety feature designed to ensure that the heart continues to beat at a steady rate if external interference is detected.If you accidentally placed a strong magnet over your pacemaker for a few hours, it is possible that the pacemaker entered magnet mode during that time. Once the magnet is removed, the pacemaker should revert to its normal programmed mode, which is responsive to the body's needs.
