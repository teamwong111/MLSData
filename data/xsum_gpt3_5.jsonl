The book had been a tool used to perpetuate anti-Semitic beliefs and ideologies, and its ban was seen as a necessary measure to prevent further harm.\n\nNow, decades after that pivotal decision was made, the copyright on the book has finally expired.

The legal move set off a wave of controversy and raised questions about the power of media censorship and the right to freedom of speech.\n\nFollowing the court order, the spotlight turned to TD Catherine Murphy, a member of the Irish parliament, who took advantage of parliamentary privilege to openly discuss Denis O'Brien's financial affairs. This parliamentary privilege allows lawmakers to speak freely without fear of legal repercussions, and Murphy used this platform to voice concerns about O'Brien's financial dealings without violating the court injunction.\n\nThe TD's comments reignited public interest in the case and sparked a national conversation about the intersection of media freedom, privacy rights, and governmental oversight. Critics of O'Brien's injunction argued that it was a blatant attempt to silence critical reporting and shield information from public scrutiny.\n\nAs the debate continues to unfold, many are questioning the balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring transparency in public life.
