This phenomenon is highly dependent on the physical characteristics and sizes of the dust grains. The absorption of starlight by these particles gives rise to distinct spectral features that are informative of the dust's composition, structure, and its interaction with the interstellar medium.In a detailed study of cosmic dust, it has been observed that the attenuation of starlight is not uniform but varies with the grain size and properties. Larger dust grains tend to absorb more efficiently at shorter wavelengths, resulting in a stronger attenuation of visible and near-infrared starlight. Conversely, smaller grains are more effective at absorbing longer wavelengths, which leads to a prominent emission in the mid- to far-infrared regions of the spectrum.The varying absorption and emission characteristics of cosmic dust grains are governed by their intricate structure and chemical composition.
