Central to this approach is the formulation of the cooperative automation challenge as a centralized optimization problem, whereupon the overarching objective revolves around making holistic decisions that optimize overall system performance and efficiency.In the realm of automated vehicle systems, cooperative automation entails vehicles working in concert to achieve common goals such as improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, or enhancing safety.

{"idx": 455, "text": "广义零样本学习（Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, GZSL）与传统的零样本学习（Zero-Shot Learning, ZSL）是两个具有不同挑战性的研究方向。传统零样本学习主要关注于对从未见过的类别进行预测的情况，而广义零样本学习则进一步扩展了这一概念，不仅考虑了未见过的类别，还考虑了可能存在的噪声或误标记的样本。在GZSL环境下，分类精度显著低于传统ZSL的主要原因在于其面临的额外挑战。首先，GZSL需要处理未见过类别的同时，还要应对可能存在的误标记数据，这增加了模型复杂度和学习难度。其次，数据集中的类别分布不均衡、特征表示的不确定性以及跨模态的关联性缺失等问题，都可能导致模型在遇到新类别时表现不佳。最后，缺乏足够的训练数据来准确估计新类别特征，也是造成分类精度下降的重要因素之一。为了提升GZSL环境下的分类性能，研究者们提出了一系列方法和技术。例如，通过引入辅助任务来增强模型对新类别的理解，使用注意力机制来聚焦关键特征以提高泛化能力，以及开发新的特征表示学习策略", "label": 0, "source": "scigen_qwen", "lang": "zh"}
