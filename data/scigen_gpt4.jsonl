This capacity for summarization and reduction of data complexity proves highly beneficial in fields such as image processing, market segmentation, and bioinformatics.However, there exists a notable drawback when utilizing k-means cluster centers as representative points. The fundamental limitation arises from the inherent sensitivity of the k-means algorithm to the initialization of centroids and the presence of outliers or noisy data.
