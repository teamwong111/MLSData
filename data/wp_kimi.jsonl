It was a story of two entities, revered by some and whispered about by others, known as Omniscience and Omnipotence.\n\nIn the beginning, there was a great debate among the inhabitants of this realm. Some believed that there was a single, all-encompassing force that held the universe together, while others argued that there were multiple powers at play—three, four, or even a hundred. But the wisest among them knew that at the heart of all existence, there were always only two: the All-Knowing and the All-Powerful.\n\nOmniscience, the All-Knowing, was the embodiment of knowledge and wisdom. It was said that Omniscience held every memory, every thought, and every possibility within its vast, infinite mind. It could see the past, the present, and the future, all at once, and understood the intricate dance of cause and effect that played out across the universe.\n\nOmnipotence, the All-Powerful, was the force of creation and destruction.

He stuffed the receipt into his wallet, a well-worn accessory that held more than just currency—it was a repository of memories, each receipt a story of its own.\n\nAs", "label": 0, "source": "wp_kimi", "lang": "en"}
