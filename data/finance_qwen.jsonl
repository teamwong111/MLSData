These companies often have more stable earnings, higher dividends, and are considered less risky compared to smaller companies.

It's essentially a portion of the company's earnings that the company chooses to share with its investors. Dividends can be paid out in cash or stock. When a company pays dividends, it reduces its retained earnings ( (profits kept by the company) and increases its dividends payable liability. 2. **Share Split**:\nA share split occurs when a company divides each existing share into multiple shares. For example, a 2-for-1 split means that every shareholder gets two shares for each share they owns. This increases the number of shares outstanding but without changing the total value of the investment. The price per share usually decreases proportionately so that the total market capitalization ( the total value of all outstanding shares) remains the same. Share splits are typically used to make stocks more affordable to new investors.3. **Redemption of Shares**:\nShare redemption refers to the process where a company buys back its own shares from the market.
