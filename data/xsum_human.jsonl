{"idx": 1, "text": "Instead of fees rising to PS9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to PS6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades. It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth PS11.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further PS500m per year. This would be covered by the PS48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around PS7.5bn to PS8bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show PS76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the PS10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5 in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned PS10,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at PS6,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about PS100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes. There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton. And the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland. For England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

He says he may be killed if he goes home but Ethiopia's government says he will be welcomed as a hero. However, state media is not showing photos of him crossing the line. There has been a wave of protests in Ethiopia in recent months over a series of frustrations, including attempts by the governments to reallocate land in the Oromo and Amhara regions. US-based Human Rights Watch says security forces have killed more than 400 Oromo protesters, a figure the government disputes. Rule 50 of the Olympic charter bans political displays or protests and the IOC say they are gathering information about the case. The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in neighbouring Kenya says Mr Feyisa is being described by some as the bravest Olympian at the Rio Games for his anti-government protest, but he now faces the prospect of a life in exile. Within hours of his protest, a crowd-funding page was set up, saying the runner had displayed \"extraordinary heroism\" and that he had become an \"international symbol\" for the Oromo protests. The California-based organiser had initially set a target of 10,000 but it was exceeded within an hour. \"We raised the bar to 25,000 and that too was exceeded in a few hours,\" Solomon Ungashe wrote on Facebook. After the race, Mr Feyisa explained why, as an Oromo, he supported the protests about land and resources. \"The Ethiopian government is killing my people so I stand with all protests anywhere as Oromo is my tribe. My relatives are in prison and if they talk about democratic rights they are killed,\" he said. A legal team hired by Ethiopians in US is headed to Rio to try and help Mr Feyisa, who has a wife and two children in Ethiopia, with a request to seek asylum in the US. But Information Minister Getachew Reda told the BBC the government had no reason to arrest him and it respected his political opinion. He also said none of Mr Feyisa's relatives had been jailed over the Oromo protests.

{"idx": 14, "text": "SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year. Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios. The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club. A BEAR BEGINNING In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime. But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience. \"I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said'how do you know about those?' \"They said that'he always tells us the story you told him last night'. \"We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful. \"We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back.\" Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices. Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam. Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team. HOLLYWOOD BECKONS Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989. With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it \"one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make.\" But the company flourished. As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld. NORM OF THE NORTH Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear. Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic. Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology. \"We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,\" said Young. \"It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do.\" The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week.

There have also been claims so-called moderate Labour MPs could be unseated by pressure from the grass-roots Momentum group, formed from Mr Corbyn's leadership campaign, which the group denies. In his article, Mr Blair also defended his party's record under his leadership, during which he said it had \"effectively discarded\" its ideological commitment to socialism. Labour \"fell short\" in areas when hard choices had to be made, he said, with \"significant elements\" of the party unhappy with the \"compromise\" and \"pragmatism\" required for government, seeing it as a betrayal of Labour's principles. Looking forward, Mr Blair said \"more modernising and less ideological thinking\" was needed to cope with challenges such as the housing shortage and social exclusion. \"Right now we're in danger of not asking the right questions, never mind failing to get the right answers,\" he said. Many current Labour members feel the party \"lost its way\" in government, Mr Blair concluded. \"I feel we found it,\" he said. \"But I accept in the process we failed to convince enough people that the true progressives are always the modernisers, not because they discard principle but because they have the courage to adhere to it when confronted with reality.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 18, "text": "The star whisked through 23 songs in 90 minutes, in a blur of pyrotechnics, lasers and multiple costume changes. She donned silken butterfly wings for a piano-led version of...Baby One More Time, and dressed as a ringmaster during a Circus-themed segment. Spears even made a passable attempt at a London accent while chatting to the audience between songs. \"Do you wanna get norr-tee?\" she teased, doing her best Sid James impersonation before launching into Freakshow - during which she dragged a (slightly over-enthusiastic) member of the audience around the stage on a leash. It was all great fun but, without the elaborate set pieces of her Vegas production, Spears' shortcomings were left exposed. Her vocals rarely seemed to be coming from the microphone, while her dancing lacked attitude and bite. The choreography was over-reliant on hand gestures; and Spears showed a tendency to slip in and out of time, like a clockwork doll whose mechanism had worn out. Her biggest blunder came during the song Touch of My Hand, as she leant over a dancer's arm to initiate a backflip, but teetered on her heels and aborted the move. Frustratingly, Spears showed glimpses of her former glories - pulling off a series of impressive lifts, as well as a punchy dance breakdown during Womanizer - but the routines more often felt like they were stuck in the rehearsal room. Tabloids will undoubtedly criticise the star for miming (the producers insist she sings over a pre-recorded backing track) but, at this point, expecting Spears to sing live is like turning up at Nando's and ordering truffles: The only person you're disappointing is yourself. In the end, Spears has always played second fiddle to her songs - especially in the second half of her career, following a much-documented breakdown in 2007 that means her life is still controlled by a court-approved conservatorship - and those songs provided an unshakeable foundation to her act. By now, the 34-year-old has accumulated enough hits to be able to dispense with...Baby One More Time and Oops!...I Did It Again at the top of her show, without worrying about the consequences. Later highlights included an energised version of Gimme More and a pounding, gothic revamp of the early single Stronger. The star only played one new song - the ethereal, beatific Make Me - which may count as a missed opportunity to reinvigorate sales of her album, Glory, which tumbled down the charts to number 94 last Friday, after just three weeks on sale. But it was the 2004 hit Toxic that received the most enthusiastic reception from the audience, whose singing almost drowned out the loudspeakers at London's Roundhouse. Among the fans joining in with the Britney karaoke were Sam Smith, Rita Ora, Nicholas Hoult and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt; while thousands more were able to watch at home, as the gig was streamed as part of the Apple Music Festival. Spears seemed overwhelmed by the reaction, clasping her hand to her mouth and blurting out, \"You guys have been amazing,\" as she left the stage. Fans may have a long wait before she repeats the show in the UK, however, with her Las Vegas residency already booking into 2017. The Apple Music festival continues until the end of the week, with performances from Michael Buble and Chance The Rapper.

The site, which is 750m from where he was last seen, is close to where officers started digging last month. They were clearing an area where it is believed a digger driver may have accidentally run Ben over on the day he disappeared. Officers are working on the theory that Konstantinos Barkas, who died of cancer in 2015, might be responsible for Ben's death. Read more about this story and others from across Sheffield and South Yorkshire Det Insp Jon Cousins said the search at the second site was of \"great significance\" and would take four days. \"It is at a different site to the farmhouse but I understand from what other people are telling me.... that some material is believed to have been moved from that area and could well be here,\" he said. Mr Cousins said the searches, which have now been taking place for nearly two weeks, would continue in the area around the farmhouse. \"There are still primary sites here [at the farmhouse] that I need to make sure we go through. But I do think it's important to start work on the second site as well.\" On Wednesday, Ben's grandfather Eddie Needham spent about two hours with police touring the area when the toddler was last seen. Mr Needham was renovating the farmhouse when his grandson went missing and police hoped he would be able to explain how the site looked at the time. An extension of the building, added since Ben's disappearance, was demolished on Wednesday.

{"idx": 21, "text": "Energy will travel via the world's longest sub-sea electricity interconnector. The a'!2bn (PS1.4bn) project has been rubber stamped between National Grid and its Norwegian equivalent Statnett. The UK aims to import enough hydro-power from Norway to provide 14 of yearly household electricity needs. Alan Foster, director of European business development for National Grid, said: \"Access to low-carbon energy from Norway hydro-power stations will help us meet the challenge of greener, affordable energy. \"It also adds to the diversity of energy sources for UK and potentially can reduce peak prices, with benefits for consumers and businesses.\" Statnett chief executive Auke Lont said: \"Not only is this a technically impressive project where we will set a new world record, it is also an important contribution to the increase of renewable energy production on both sides.\" The North Sea Network (NSN) interconnector is due to be completed in 2021 and will have a capacity of 1.4 gigawatts (GW). The sub-sea electricity cable will connect the two countries' electricity markets directly for the first time. Energy secretary Ed Davey said: \"Britain will benefit from Norwegian green hydropower, at the flick of a switch, providing green back-up power when the wind's not blowing, and this will actually save people money.\" The new NSN interconnector will be more than 730km long and will carry enough power for 750,000 homes at peak demand, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. For average usage by households, it could power up to four million homes, she added. Most electricity in Norway is generated from hydropower, and water from Norwegian lakes will generate the electricity that will be connected into the UK network. The NSN cable will connect to the Norwegian network at Kvilldal, next to the Kvilldal power station, which at 1,240 megawatts (MW) is the largest power station in Norway in terms of capacity. The Kvilldal plant is powered by the waters in the Blasjo reservoir, the country's biggest artificial lake. The sub-sea cable will connect to the UK network at Blyth in Northumberland. Crucially, the UK will be able to call on the power at short notice. The energy will be used to manage the growing levels of intermittent wind power on the network. It will also be a two-way link. Norway will be able to import power from the UK during dry periods when hydroelectric power is less widely available. According to the government, the link will help the UK benefit from Norway's cheaper electricity prices. It estimates that the interconnector will deliver consumer benefits of up to PS3.5bn through to 2040. By reducing the need for new gas-fired power plants, the government insists the link will also reduce the UK's green house gas emissions. Interconnectors are transmission cables that allow electricity to flow from one country to another. Energy regulator Ofgem says that they can lower consumer bills by accessing cheaper power and boosting UK energy supplies. The UK mainland currently has four interconnectors that link to France, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Together they provide around 4 GW of electricity capacity. This represents about 4 of Britain's electricity supply. The energy regulator is currently examining the need for two further interconnectors to France and one to Denmark. Last month, National Grid signed a joint venture agreement with the Belgian electricity transmission operator, Elia, to develop Nemo, the first electricity interconnector between the two countries.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out. Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor. The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had \"only contributed to the violence, not stopped it.\" The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the \"de-escalation zones.\" The objective is to \"put an immediate end to the violence\" and \"provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees\" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible.

{"idx": 25, "text": "Inspectors in abattoirs used to be able to cut open pig carcasses to check for signs of disease. But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone. The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread. Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK. Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected. Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: \"Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now. \"There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.\" Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods. The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA. The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern. He said: \"The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control. \"We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.\" But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses. Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes. Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork. He sees the new hands-off approach as \"a backward step\" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do. But he says: \"Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product? We'll end up with a two-tier system.\" Shadow food and farming minister Huw Irranca-Davies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA. He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britain's exports, which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards. Mr Irranca-Davies said: \"We want to see absolute categoric assurances that this is not jeopardising consumer protection and we're not reassured yet because despite the work that the FSA has been doing over a few years now to look at this issue, what they have presented to us is not a compelling case for a change in the way that this works.\" A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman said: \"The changes to the meat inspections will mean less cutting and handling of carcasses and offal, reducing the potential risk of harmful bacteria spreading onto the meat. \"Pigs will continue to be inspected for lesions by a vet and again after slaughter by a meat inspector. \"All pigs for export will be inspected using the methods agreed with the markets we export to.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament. Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains. \"I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,\" he said. \"When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens.\" Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3. Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome. \"If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,\" he said. \"There's something in you that helps you deal with that. \"It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal. \"As long as you can look back on a game and say'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts.\" Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a \"great game\" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle. \"For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,\" added Owens.

He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs \"being returned from Wales in large numbers.\" \"We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales,\" he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. \"I don't think we will be wiped out here,\" he said. \"We've got a good record in government.... we're directly engaged in our local communities,\" he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was \"appalled\" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the \"triple lock\" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a \"more open relationship\" with the EU than a \"hard\" Brexit, calling for \"full and unfettered\" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was \"economically beneficial.\" \"There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment,\" he said. \"I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants.\" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: \"A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 32, "text": "Hamilton said he was drawing on Ali's famous \"rope-a-dope\" victory over George Foreman in 1974 as he seeks to close the 29-point gap to the German. \"I think about Muhammad Ali,\" Hamilton told BBC Sport. \"He sat on the rope and let [Foreman] have the upper hand until he decided it was the right time to turn it around.\" Ahead of Sunday's British Grand Prix, Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, added: \"I'm hoping I can do a similar thing. He inspires me in that fight.\" Hamilton thinks it is important to beat Rosberg this weekend. The Englishman has finished second to his rival in two of the last three races and retired from the other. \"I am going to do everything to be out front,\" said Hamilton, who has had two retirements this year. In contrast, Rosberg has finished every race, winning three grands prix and finishing second five times. \"Winning your home grand prix is one of the greatest experiences you can have as a driver,\" added Hamilton. \"I'm hopeful I don't have any more bad luck with the non-finishes and it's time to turn things around.\" Hamilton has not won at Silverstone since 2008, when he dominated in wet conditions to take one of the greatest victories of his career. Former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button hopes there will be another British victory this weekend but says the pressure is on Hamilton. \"It would be amazing to have a British victory,\" said the 2009 world champion. \"The crowd would go wild. \"For myself, it's going to be tricky to get on the top step. Lewis has got a shot. Let's hope it happens.\" The flowing, fast Silverstone circuit and the huge crowds - 80,000 spectators are expected to attend practice on Friday, with about 95,000 due for Saturday's qualifying and 120,000 for the race on Sunday - make the British Grand Prix a favourite amongst drivers. Rosberg says he will do everything he could to prevent Hamilton recording a home victory on Sunday. \"I definitely am going to try,\" the German said. \"It's not going to be easy here, but I will do my best and I'm optimistic.\" Having won seven of the eight races so far this season, only missing out in Canada last month when they ran into a rare reliability problem, Mercedes are expected to win at Silverstone, with Hamilton and Rosberg fighting it out at the front. World champions Red Bull should be their closest challengers, despite a poor race in Austria two weeks ago. Daniel Ricciardo, who was eighth in Austria, is the highest Red Bull driver in the championship in third place, 82 points behind Rosberg. The Australian, who took his maiden career victory in Canada, said the team said the team think they know what went wrong in Austria and were expecting a better weekend at Silverstone. That's because the plethora of high-speed corners suits the aerodynamic excellence of the Red Bull, while the power disadvantage of the Renault compared to the Mercedes engine is less of a handicap. \"If we can be the strong package we normally are here, it can definitely bring us close to the other teams,\" said Ricciardo. \"All going well, I think we should be the ones behind Mercedes. I think they'll still be quickest but whether that's half a second or two or three tenths [of a second] we'll have to find out. \"If we get it all right we can be within a couple of three tenths from them.\" Ferrari are in a similar situation to Red Bull, with a good car let down by a poor engine, but double world champion Fernando Alonso is pessimistic about his chances of a podium finish at Silverstone. In fact, the Spaniard does not think his team will taste victory at all this season. \"If I'm honest with you, I would say no, it's not possible to win this year,\" Alonso said. \"But I thought in 2011 it was impossible to win a race and we won here. \"Anything can happen in this sport, so we try to do the best we can. If one opportunity arrives, we will take it to win a race, but it is extremely difficult to win with the performance we are showing.\" If Alonso fails to register a win in 2014, it would be the first time since 2009 the 32-year-old has not won at least once in a season and only the second time since 2003. Alonso said he expected Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa, who locked out the front row and finished the race third and fourth in Austria, would again be strong in Silverstone. \"They will be a threat,\" Alonso said.

Car and parts production has already been halted at four plants and will be stopped at two others later this week. The carmaker said the interruptions in production would affect 27,700 staff. \"Although Braunschweig District Court has issued injunctions obliging the suppliers to resume deliveries, the suppliers have not as yet met their obligations. Volkswagen continues its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers,\" said the company in a statement. The two suppliers are CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which makes cast iron parts used in gearboxes. They are demanding compensation from VW because they say they their incomes were hit when VW cancelled a contract. VW says it is continuing its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers. The company said the production stoppage would not affect cars that have already been ordered. Any effect on future production will depend on how long the dispute lasts. Some production has already been halted at Wolfsburg, which makes Golfs, and at Zwickau where Golfs and Passats are made. Production is due to begin again later this week. Production has also stopped at Braunschweig, which makes chassis parts and plastic parts, but should start again next Monday. Later this week, production will cease at Salzgitter, which is involved in engine production, and Kassel where transmission and exhaust system production takes place. In what the company said was an unrelated issue, production was halted at Emden, which makes Passats, last week and will resume on Wednesday. In some cases employees have been sent home, in others they are engaged in short-time working on other jobs within the plants. The German Economy Ministry on Monday called on VW and the suppliers end the dispute. \"We assume and also expect the companies to solve the sticking issues as soon as possible,\" Economy Ministry spokesman Andreas Audretsch told journalists during a regular news conference. He added: \"It is about thousands of jobs, which could be affected by shorter work hours, and the responsibility to tackle these problems constructively is very high.\" VW in the UK issued a statement in which it said the company was \"working intensively on minimising the acute supply risk, the priority being to maintain production in some areas and to ensure that deliveries can be made to customers. \"Volkswagen currently expects to be able to adhere to all confirmed delivery dates,\" it added.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 37, "text": "It said it had taken a PS235m charge after it agreed a deferred prosecution with the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Conduct Authority in March. However, Tesco said it exceeded its full-year operating profit target. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new store openings, grew 1 in the year to 28 February. UK like-for-like sales were up 0.9, their first reported growth since 2009-10. However, Tesco shares closed down 5.7, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The stock has now declined more than 10 this year. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said the results showed \"another solid year of progress\" at the supermarket giant. \"The very pleasing thing is that on every dimension of customer service we've had positive feedback from customers of the service that we're giving, and that's allowed us to drive an improvement in both sales and indeed profitability,\" he told the BBC's Emma Simpson. Full year pre-tax profit, which includes one-off charges such as legal costs, fell from PS202m to PS145m. But Tesco's operating profit figure, which strips out exceptional items and reflects the performance of the business, was PS1.28bn, exceeding Tesco's PS1.2bn target. By 2020, Mr Lewis wants Tesco to make between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every PS1 spent by shoppers, up from 2.3p in 2016-17. The company is banking on rising sales, allowing it to cut PS1.5bn of costs. The supermarket also needs strong results to help it persuade shareholders to back its attempt to buy wholesaler Booker. Last month, one of its biggest shareholders said it had \"major concerns\" about the PS3.7bn bid, saying it was overpaying. Tesco said the deal would improve its recovery plans. The supermarket giant's pension deficit more than doubled from PS2.6bn to PS5.5bn after higher inflation, said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Kalaf. \"The supermarket is facing the prospect of a rise in pension contributions because its scheme valuation is rather inconveniently taking place now, when interest rates are low and inflation is rising, both of which will serve to magnify the deficit,\" he said. Kantar Retail analyst Ray Gaul said Tesco can \"successfully put the accounting scandals of the past behind them having settled legal affairs.\" \"Now, Tesco will begin to fight all of its battles on the front foot,\" he said. Upcoming \"battles\" include regulatory battles over the proposed Booker deal. Suppliers raising prices to cope with increased costs will be another test, Mr Gaul said. The pound has substantially weakened since the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June, pushing up the cost of imports. The rate of grocery price inflation is expected to rise to 2.3, with higher rises on the horizon, he added. Dave Lewis told the BBC that Tesco \"want to do everything we can to stop prices rising.... but the fact is, they are, and there is some pressure in terms of pricing.\" He said customers were starting to shift spending to \"fresh food\" and \"everyday essentials\" rather than \"luxuries.\" Supermarkets have been contending with factors including rising costs, the devaluation of the pound and structural shifts in the industry. Mr Lewis said: \"It's no surprise that the industry has been under pressure, but it has been under pressure for the last three or four years as well. Actually I think that where we sit as Tesco now is stronger than we've been for quite some time.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The company reported a 4 decline in profits to 1.89bn in the first quarter from 1.98bn in 2015. However, global sales volumes rose 2 in the first quarter. Its performance was helped by brands including Fanta and strength in still drinks such as bottled water and sports drinks. But the world's biggest drinks maker said that sales volume for drinks like Diet Coke and Cherry Coke declined in North America, Europe and the Middle East and Africa. \"Our operating results are driven by our commitment to sustainable growth, and we are confident that we have the right strategies in place to achieve our full-year outlook and drive long-term value for our system and shareowners,\" said chief executive officer Muhtar Kent.

{"idx": 42, "text": "Amber Rudd told the BBC the manifesto was \"not going to be identical to the last one\" and said things had changed since 2015 because of Brexit. The target, set by David Cameron in 2010, has never been met and recent figures put net migration at 273,000. The PM indicated in April that she would stick with the aim. Speaking on a campaign visit last month, Theresa May, who was Ms Rudd's predecessor as home secretary, told the BBC: \"We want to see sustainable net migration in this country.\" \"I believe that sustainable net migration is in the tens of thousands.\" Questions had been raised about whether the commitment would feature in the Conservative manifesto after Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said that immigration was \"not about putting numbers on it\" but about ensuring Britain had the skilled workers it needed. Asked whether she agreed with her colleague, Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics: \"It's too early to say. I appreciate you want to push me on this but we are going to have to wait until the manifesto comes out.\" Pressed on the issue again, she added: \"That's why we're having a new manifesto. It's not going to be identical to the last one. \"We're setting it out for hopefully for a five year term, we've got a lot to think through to work out what's the best way to deliver on our priorities.\" She added: \"My personal view is, we need to continue to bring immigration down. I want to make sure that we do it in a way that supports businesses, you know we're ending freedom of movement when we leaving the European Union. \"So the situation from that time the [2015] manifesto.... has changed because we're leaving the European Union, so it's right that we look at it again.\" Ms Rudd also played down the potential impact of excluding students from net migration figures, saying: \"It's a complete red herring to talk about taking students out of those numbers and it making a big impact.\" This was because, in theory, roughly the same numbers of students should be leaving the UK at the end of their courses as are arriving each year. Official figures out last month show EU migrants make up more than one in 10 manufacturing sector workers in the UK. The government has promised new migration controls after the UK leaves the EU, when freedom of movement rules will no longer apply, but it has yet to set out the precise model it will adopt. Labour says it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said new immigration controls should not be the \"overarching priority\" as the UK leaves. UKIP has said that Mrs May's failure to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 while she was home secretary suggests that she could yet \"back slide\" on delivering Brexit.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 43, "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Real took the lead in the ninth minute through Karim Benzema, but Gaku Shibasaki scored either side of half-time to put Kashima in front. Ronaldo levelled from the penalty spot on the hour mark after Lucas Vazquez was fouled by Shuto Yamamoto. The Ballon d'Or winner put his side ahead in extra time after being played through by Benzema, and completed his hat-trick seven minutes later. Listen: 2016 - the year of Ronaldo? Victory gave Real their second Club World Cup and extended their unbeaten run to 37 games in all competitions. It also means nine of the past 10 winners of the competition have come from Europe. The Champions League winners looked set for a comfortable afternoon when Benzema put them ahead, and they dominated possession in the opening stages. But Kashima - the first Japanese team to reach a Club World Cup final - impressed in an entertaining game, and Shibasaki took both goals well. Indeed, after Ronaldo's equalising penalty, Kashima had the better chances late in normal time. First Keylor Navas saved a long-range strike from Fabricio, then Yasushi Endo shot wide at the back post with the final kick of the 90 minutes. At 3-2 down, Yuma Suzuki hit the bar with a header. The Japanese side also felt Real captain Sergio Ramos should have been sent off in normal time when he appeared to body-check an opponent when on a yellow card. Referees used video replays to review several decisions during the competition, but Janny Sikazwe chose not take a second look at this incident. \"The referee lacked courage, which was regrettable,\" said Kashima coach Masatada Ishii. Victory for Ronaldo capped an impressive year for the forward, coming six days after he won the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best player. He scored the winning penalty in Real's Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in May, before captaining Portugal to Euro 2016 success in the summer. His hat-trick in Yokohama was the first in a Club World Cup final, and he is now the joint-top scorer in the competition's history with five goals. \"What a game,\" said Ronaldo. \"We had to suffer, but that's what finals are about. It's a trophy we really wanted to win and we end the year in the best way possible so I'm very happy.\" Ronaldo has now won the Club World Cup three times, having done so previously with Manchester United in 2008 and Real in 2014. He was already the only player to win the competition with two different clubs. Having taken over as Real coach from Rafael Benitez in January, Zinedine Zidane's first year in management has been remarkable. The Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup have all been won during an unbeaten run stretching back to April. That adds to the former France international's achievements as a player, when he won the World Cup, European Championship, La Liga, Serie A, Champions League, Intertoto Cup, Intercontinental Cup and Uefa Super Cup.

Ex-leader Neil Kinnock said Labour appeared unelectable under Mr Corbyn and faced its \"greatest crisis.\" Labour will announce whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest on 24 September. Ahead of the vote, Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of seeking to \"deepen divisions\" between the party's membership - seen as overwhelmingly in favour of the leader - and its MPs - who are largely opposed to him. But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was \"determined\" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win. Referring to the \"diverse\" crowds of tens of thousands of people who have attended his leadership rallies in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said they showed \"there is an interest in politics.... that then becomes surely a very strong campaigning base for the Labour movement.\" He added: \"I think you'll see it begin to play out, particularly in the local elections next year and after that.\" In June, 20 members of the shadow cabinet resigned, and one was sacked, over differences with Mr Corbyn.

Mr Corbyn told Today he would \"reach out to\" Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership \"as I've reached out to them in the past.\" He said: \"I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we've been elected as Labour MPs... \"It doesn't mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party.\" On Tuesday, Labour's national executive committee meets and will consider a plan put forward by deputy leader Tom Watson to allow the parliamentary party - its MPs and peers currently serving in Westminster - to elect the shadow cabinet, as part of efforts to reunite the party as a whole. At the moment they are appointed by the leader. Newspaper reports suggested that, under the new plan, a third of Labour's top team could be elected by the parliamentary party, another third by the party membership, and the final third chosen by the leader. Mr Corbyn has not given his support to the proposal but has indicated he would back members having a say.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 45, "text": "Kirsty Williams told them they have a \"responsibility as stewards of community, city and country,\" at a speech in Cardiff. The referendum showed \"notions of togetherness\" were \"perhaps weaker than we imagined,\" she warned academics. The Conservatives said she had offered some \"nuggets of wisdom\" but was \"exaggerating a sense of crisis.\" Universities and the Ms Williams campaigned for the UK to remain an EU member before the vote in June. However, Brexit was backed by 52.5 of voters in Wales, with 47.5 supporting Remain. On Monday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales must get away from the abuse and bitterness of the referendum campaign. Speaking at Cardiff University on Thursday, Ms Williams claimed there was an \"urgency\" for universities to \"recapture a civic mission\" after the Leave vote. She suggested the existence of much of what is taken for granted in modern life might not be as secure as many people believe. \"The victories that help bend the arc of history towards progress - feminism, opening up access to education, civility in our discourse and towards others, civil rights, even devolution - may be far more fragile than we imagined,\" Ms Williams said. \"The vote showed that when people and communities think advancements are for the benefit of others - rather than for them, their families or society at large - they will think they have nothing to lose by standing against these.\" Urging colleges to do more to reach out to people across Wales, Ms Williams said the referendum exposed the \"distance between campus and community.\" She warned: \"At a UK-level, the pro-EU campaign of universities was too easily dismissed as one of self-interest, almost exclusively focused on income. \"This is not to exempt politicians and government from criticism, far from it. But it is certainly incumbent on universities to reflect on the distance between campus and community exposed by the referendum.\" Ms Williams has also announced she is establishing a Welsh Higher Education Brexit Working Group, to advise on the \"impact and possibilities\" arising from the UK's departure from the European Union. Six years ago the then Education Minister Leighton Andrews said university governance was \"the last resting place of the crachach\" - elitist and detached from mainstream Welsh society. In her first big address to university bosses, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams's tone was distinctly less confrontational. But her more nuanced message still displayed a view in government that institutions getting millions in public money should do more for their communities and the nation. \"They can't hide behind the walls of their very fine buildings - they have to be a part of the communities in which they are placed and the country as a whole - they recognise that,\" she told me afterwards. The EU referendum - in which the universities argued strongly to stay in - is one example of the divide between campus and community, she says. The universities' response is to say they are committed to bridging the gap and will build on what they already do in their communities. And both government and universities will hope the Diamond Review on higher education finance, due to report later this month, will go some way to resolving the tensions between them over funding. Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar accused the minister of \"exaggerating a sense of crisis and division.\" \"There are some nuggets of wisdom in this speech, and few would argue that the gap between campus and community has widened over the course of a generation,\" he said. \"However, the suggestion that Wales' decision to leave the EU has somehow placed education, civil rights or feminism under threat is absolute nonsense.\" Cardiff University vice chancellor Prof Colin Riordan, who chairs Universities Wales, said: \"Being part of and contributing to community has always been at the heart of what we do as universities.\" He added: \"We are proud of our successes, but we can do more to embrace and appreciate the cultural and social diversity of the communities within which we sit.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 46, "text": "It's known as a technique called \"cupping\" where heated cups are placed on the skin. Cupping is done by lighting flammable liquid in a small glass cup. Once the flame goes out, the drop in temperature creates suction, making the cups stick to the body. The suction pulls the skin away from the body and is thought to improve blood flow and leaves the red marks, which usually last for a few days. The most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, Michael Phelps, has been seen with the circles on his skin, as have various other athletes. It's not only athletes who use cupping, lots of celebrities have been spotted with what look like cupping marks. Athletes say they are using it to help with aches and pains, and to help them recover from constant training and competing. The British Acupuncture Council say cupping is not painful but they warn that the hot cups can cause mild burns on rare occasions. It has rules of practice for cupping, and advises people only to visit properly-trained people who are members of their organisation.

{"idx": 47, "text": "Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989. Swift had argued that Apple withholding payments during a three-month trial period was not fair for artists. But photographer Jason Sheldon said the singer herself did not \"play fair\" when it came to image rights. Some of the claims he has made in an open letter to Swift have been disputed by representatives of the 25-year-old singer. In it he wrote: \"If you don't like being exploited, that's great - make a huge statement about it, and you'll have my support. But how about making sure you're not guilty of the very same tactic before you have a pop at someone else? \"With all due respect to you too Taylor, you can do the right thing and change your photo policy. Photographers don't ask for your music for free. Please don't ask us to provide you with your marketing material for free.\" Mr Sheldon, who runs the Walsall-based Junction 10 agency, said he and other photographers had been called to hand over some rights to their images from Swift's live concerts. To cover a performance in March 2011 at Birmingham's LG Arena, Mr Sheldon said he had to sign a permission form that granted Swift's management company long-term rights to reuse the images and prevented him from featuring them after the initial coverage. \"I can't use it in my portfolio, feature it on my website and even the original newspaper couldn't reuse it,\" Mr Sheldon said. \"What's more, they can give my image to my clients for press purposes. It's giving my work away for free.\" He said the photo authorisation form included a section that gave the management firm \"perpetual worldwide right to use (and to authorise others to use) any or all of the photographs for any non-commercial purpose.\" Mr Sheldon said clauses such as this were becoming more common in photo agreement forms. He said it was Swift's stance with Apple that \"jarred\" - with her \"lambasting\" the firm over using music for free, when her management firm was \"guilty of doing the same thing with photos.\" In a statement, a spokesperson for Swift said: \"The standard photography agreement has been misrepresented in that it clearly states that any photographer shooting The 1989 World Tour has the opportunity for further use of said photographs with management's approval. \"Another distinct misrepresentation is the claim that the copyright of the photographs will be with anyone other than the photographer - this agreement does not transfer copyright away from the photographer. \"Every artist has the right to, and should, protect the use of their name and likeness.\" Mr Sheldon said he had seen a 2015 version of the same contract that was even more strict, although he had not applied for one. \"I fully agree with Taylor Swift's stance against Apple, but it's about her playing by the same rules she wants to live by,\" he said.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 48, "text": "As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room. Once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009. We had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain. But Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case. But put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin? At our first meeting - without a television camera - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation. We challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an \"audit\" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin. We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself. He talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the \"lefty\" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig \"Satoshi\" just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel. What he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - \"that would be telling\" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a \"nice big house and a nice fast car\" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches. The second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better. At first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye. \"I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone,\" he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff. It seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin. Throughout the demonstrations he showed us he kept on stressing the complexity of the process - \"obviously everyone said I have no idea about this stuff so I'm going to do it in the most convoluted way possible.\" We were then supplied with a series of documents providing evidence that Dr Craig Stephen Wright was a Master of Statistics, IT Management, and Law, and a long list of peer-reviewed articles. Now he says he intends to continue his research into improving the technology behind Bitcoin, and plans to publish several papers over the coming months. With the community around the currency in some turmoil right now over how it develops, you might think that Craig Wright could provide some leadership. After all, he could be said to be to Bitcoin what Tim Berners-Lee is to the web. But he bridled at my suggestion that he could be a figurehead for the currency, making clear that this was the first and last television interview he would do. Having emerged from the shadows, Craig Satoshi Wright now wants to return to them as quickly as possible.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 50, "text": "Wallace's name might not have the same cachet as Keegan, Dalglish or Rush but his place in Liverpool history is unassailable - he scored the club's first European goal. His landmark moment came in Iceland when he opened the scoring in a 5-0 win over K.R. Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur in 1964. \"The great Roger Hunt went to the by-line, squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out I powered it in,\" said Wallace who was only playing because Ian St John was ill. It's more than 55 years since he left Llanelli for Liverpool, but Wallace has not lost a trace of his Welsh accent. So how did the son of a Scotland international claim his place in footballing history? And why does he have a south Wales lilt when he speaks? It's a story that takes in one of Wales' most famous rugby academies and Huddersfield Town. Wallace, now 71, recalls it all with fondness. Wallace was five years old when his father, former Scotland centre forward Dougie Wallace, was appointed player-manager at Llanelli AFC. As a teenager he went to Gwendraeth School, where Barry John - nicknamed The King - and before him Carwyn James took their first steps to rugby stardom. \"The school was rugby orientated. Barry was two years younger than me and even then I used to love to watch him play,\" Wallace told BBC Wales. \"But my childhood dream was to become a footballer. I wanted to be just like my dad.\" Wallace played in the Llanelli junior league between the ages of 11 to 14, before playing for Glan Morfa where his talent was discovered. \"It was late October 1959. I remember it well,\" he says of the day Bill Shankly's scout spotted him. \"There's somebody I want you to have a look at\" was the message sent back to Shankly, then manager of Huddersfield Town. Wallace had trials with the Terriers and when Shankly went to Liverpool, he took Wallace with him. \"At the end of my third trial at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly signed on the Monday to become manager of Liverpool Football Club,\" Wallace continued. After Liverpool won the Division One title in 1963-64, they were offered automatic qualification for the European Cup for the first time. \"Liverpool in the 60s was vibrant - The Beatles, 50,000 in the stadium, 28,000 in the Kop swaying to their songs. I remember it like yesterday,\" Wallace said. \"I wasn't always on the pitch but I was always part of the party. We had a fabulous squad. Ronnie Yates, Ian Callaghan, Roger Hunt, Ian St John. An odd person might get injured so you might get a game now and then.\" And it was sickness that gave Wallace his break when fellow Scot St John had suffered appendicitis a few weeks before Liverpool's first European tie in Iceland. Wallace recalls the journey was as memorable as the game, \"Back then you couldn't get a direct flight to Iceland. We flew to Glasgow with a six-hour wait, Shankly] didn't want us lounging around so off we went on a bus to a holiday camp. I'll always remember the fella stopping us at the gate. \"The boss went over and said,'I'm Bill Shankly, I'm going to Reykjavik in Iceland and this is Liverpool Football Club'. The guy replied,'Well you're on the wrong road, Mr Shankly, You should have taken a right back that way'.\" Wallace and the team got through the gate, onto the flight for Iceland, and a little piece of history followed. \"The goal came after three minutes,\" recalls Wallace, \"It hadn't dawned on me it was the first-ever goal in Europe until about six months later when someone mentioned it would be a good quiz question.\" He also played a leading part in another landmark game, scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Arsenal - a game televised by the BBC on the first Match of the Day. He spent another two seasons at the club before moving on to Crewe Alexandra in 1967 for PS9,000. \"I would have loved to have played a lot more games than what I did, but I was so proud to be part of that squad. Shankly started what Liverpool Football Club is today,\" he said. Wallace draws comparisons between Shankly and current Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has steered the club to Europa League final in his first season at Anfield. \"They're very, very similar,\" Wallace said, \"Klopp's so enthusiastic, he's got a great character about him. He's got the players motivated. \"The Dortmund game [where Liverpool fought back to win 5-4 on aggregate in the Europa League quarter-final] - that was second only to the Inter Milan [European Cup] semi-final [first leg] in 1965 [which Liverpool won 3-1]. \"To see Klopp on the line, chanting and running, when the players see that, they play for him like we played for Shankly.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ. He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football. He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month. \"So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,\" he added. The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East. Media playback is not supported on this device Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax. He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title. Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986. The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone.

However, six days later Snoop Dogg posted a photo of Ukogu on Instagram, telling his nearly 12 million followers that she had won a silver medal - Nigeria's first at these Games: We all have to admit that following the Olympics can be confusing, with heats and umpteen rounds before the finals. Ukogu did get through her heats, and made the quarter-finals, but needed to finish in the top three to progress to the semis with a chance of getting a medal. She came fifth in her race so was demoted to the \"CD\" semis and final. In her \"final D\" race she came second, but her time of 7:44:76 put her 18 places below silver. What may have led Snoop Dogg up the garden path was a tweet last Saturday suggesting she had won silver for Nigeria: This then got picked up on Monday and was retweeted a bit: More of such tweets appeared on Friday - though it's not clear if this was before or after Snoop Dogg instagrammed. At the time of writing, his post had nearly 97,000 likes and more than 1,000 comments, some of which pointed out that it was not true - with others saying Ukogu was still impressive and made Nigerians proud. \"We have to celebrate her for the sacrifices and selfless service to the nation,\" posted Olufemisylvester. And there is no denying that Chierika Ukogu has made history. She is the first athlete to represent Nigeria in a rowing event at the Olympics. Known to her friends as \"Coco,\" she raised 15,000 (PS11,400) herself as she said the Nigerian Rowing Federation was not able to give her financial support. She was born in the US to Nigerian parents and became hooked on rowing at senior school. She continued to row at university - she plans to become a doctor. \"I put medical school on hold to dedicate my time to training,\" she said on her GoFundMe page. \"I hope that my athletic endeavours will inspire other Nigerians to take up rowing and experience the same joy I feel every time I'm on the water.\" Her enthusiasm is a soothing balm to what has been a bumpy Rio ride for Nigeria - Africa's most populous nation. The men's football team, playing for bronze later on Saturday, is Nigeria's only realistic medal hope. The footballers only arrived hours before their first match. They had been delayed in the US city of Atlanta because of problems paying for their flight. And Nigeria's Olympic kit only turned up a few days ago, after most athletes had completed their events. For the popular Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji, Ukogu's success was all about \"girl power.\" Nnaji who also posted her praise on Instagram on Friday, but did not make the mistake about the medal.

{"idx": 55, "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: \"We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters.\" We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said,'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. Media playback is not supported on this device Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. Media playback is not supported on this device Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny: I was thinking'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny: He said:'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him:'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny: I'd done 80 of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

In his defence, Carpenter - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. Kenneth Derbyshire, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given Carpenter permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice. But he said he had made it clear he was not use it to collect funds for the charity. Carpenter told the court the banner was a tribute to the victims, not an attempt to deceive anyone.

{"idx": 57, "text": "Dubbed \"carbon farming,\" researchers say the idea is economically competitive with high-tech carbon capture and storage projects. But critics say the idea could be have unforeseen, negative impacts including driving up food prices. The research has been published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. Jatropha curcas is a plant that originated in Central America and is very well adapted to harsh conditions including extremely arid deserts. It is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world because its seeds can produce oil. In this study, German scientists showed that one hectare of jatropha could capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The researchers based their estimates on trees currently growing in trial plots in Egypt and in the Negev desert. \"The results are overwhelming,\" said Prof Klaus Becker, from the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. \"There was good growth, a good response from these plants. I feel there will be no problem trying it on a much larger scale, for example ten thousand hectares in the beginning,\" he said. According to the researchers a plantation that would cover three percent of the Arabian desert would absorb all the CO2 produced by cars and trucks in Germany over a 20 year period. The scientists say that a critical element of the plan would be the availability of desalination facilities. This means that initially, any plantations would be confined to coastal areas. They are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. Prof Becker says that unlike other schemes that just offset the carbon that people produce, the planting of jatropha could be a good, short term solution to climate change. \"I think it is a good idea because we are really extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - and it is completely different between extracting and preventing.\" According to the scientist's calculations the costs of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees would be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne. This makes it competitive with other techniques, such as the more high tech carbon capture and storage (CCS). A number of countries are currently trialling this technology but it has yet to be deployed commercially. Growing jatropha not only soaks up CO2 but has other benefits. The plants would help to make desert areas more habitable, and the plant's seeds can be harvested for biofuel say the researchers, providing an economic return. \"Jatropha is ideal to be turned into biokerosene - it is even better than biodiesel,\" said Prof Becker. But other experts in this area are not convinced. They point to the fact that in 2007 and 2008 large numbers of jatropha trees were planted for biofuel, especially in Africa. But many of these ventures ended in tears, as the plants were not very successful in coping with dry conditions. Lucy Hurn is the biofuels campaign manager for the charity, Actionaid. She says that while jatropha was once seen as the great, green hope the reality was very different. \"When jatropha was introduced it was seen as a miracle crop, it would grow on scrubland or marginal land,\" she said. \"But there are often people who need marginal land to graze their animals, they are getting food from that area - we wouldn't class the land as marginal.\" She pointed out that jatropha is highly toxic and can pollute the land it is grown on, even in a desert. And she also had concerns about the fairness of the idea. \"It is still somebody else's land. Why go in and grow these massive plantations to deal with a problem these people didn't actually cause?\" Follow Matt on Twitter.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Hiddink watched Saturday's visit of Sunderland from the stands, sat next to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and former Blues striker Didier Drogba. Coaches Steve Holland and Eddie Newton were in charge of the team for the game against the Black Cats. \"It's a fantastic appointment. I'm very happy about it. This club needs an experienced manager at the helm and Guus Hiddink is clearly that,\" said Holland. Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo said a \"palpable discord between manager and players\" had contributed to Mourinho's dismissal, the second time he has been sacked by the club. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola, who is set to reveal on Saturday if he will stay at the German club beyond the end of the season, is among the possible permanent replacements. Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone and out-of-work Carlo Ancelotti, who managed Chelsea for two seasons from June 2009, have also been suggested as potential candidates for the full-time role. A statement on the Chelsea website read: \"The owner and the board welcome back a coach with a wealth of top-level experience and success, including his previous spell with the club in 2009 when we lifted the FA Cup. \"Mr Abramovich and the board believe that Guus has what it takes to get the best out of our talented squad.\" Hiddink won six Dutch league titles and the European Cup in two spells as PSV Eindhoven manager. He has also coached South Korea, Australia and Russia. He took over at Stamford Bridge in February 2009, replacing Luiz Felipe Scolari, and shared the role with his job as Russia manager. Since then, he has endured unsuccessful spells as manager of Turkey, Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala and the Netherlands.

{"idx": 63, "text": "The party secured about 19 of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25 voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14 of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10 of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. \"Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better,\" the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: \"Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes.\" The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25 of the total vote or 20 of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3 on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. \"We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead,\" Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was \"widely open\" to a coalition. \"It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone.

{"idx": 67, "text": "A new programme, known as Drive, will be aimed at the most dangerous offenders, BBC News has been told. Backed by domestic abuse charities SafeLives and Respect, it will be piloted in Essex, Sussex and South Wales. But domestic violence charity Refuge said there was \"no evidence\" therapy for violent partners was effective. Rachel Williams from Newport, who suffered 18 years of domestic violence at the hands of her late husband, Darren Williams, said: \"If you don't deal with the perpetrator, who's the problem, all they'll do is go on to the next victim.\" In 2011, after Ms Williams filed for divorce, her husband burst into her hair salon armed with a sawn-off shotgun and shot her in the leg, before hanging himself in woodland. Six weeks later, as she was recovering in hospital, the body of her 16-year-old son, Jack, was found hanged in the same spot. Ms Williams, 44, who has since remarried, said her former husband would have benefited from the scheme. \"He was a control freak and he needed his actions addressing,\" she said. \"We've got to try and change the mindset of the perpetrator and hold them accountable for their actions.\" One woman who survived a \"hellish five-year marriage to a physically, emotionally and financially abusive man\" said she did not believe the Drive scheme would be effective and it would be better to spend the money on support for victims. \"The majority - although not all - of serial perpetrators of domestic violence do it out of choice, not because they have drug, alcohol, social or financial problems,\" she said. \"They will use this Drive scheme as a way to avoid prison and they will deliberately make it look as though they are reforming until they are'signed off' and deemed safe. \"They will then simply find another victim and go back to how they were.\" Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said there was \"no evidence - here or abroad - that therapy programmes for violent partners work.\" She added: \"On the face of it, it seems like a worthy thing to do. In an ideal world we would approach this from both sides. But we don't live in an ideal world. \"We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust.\" Although there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different. It is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder. Unlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions. They will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have. Advice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available. Those who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour. Diana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: \"Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time. \"If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill. \"Focusing on crisis management is of course vital but we want to help victims today and reduce the number of victims of tomorrow - and we can only do this by getting to the root and the cause of the problem - the perpetrator.\" It is expected that 900 offenders will be asked to take part in the scheme over the next three years. It also has support from Social Finance, a not-for-profit organisation, and is funded by police and crime commissioners in the three areas, as well as the Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales and the Tudor Trust.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed. So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker. \"There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,\" he says. \"The chat room is like the foyer of a church.\" Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included: Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons. \"We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,\" says Mr Parker. \"The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.\" The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website. Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union. The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release. \"Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,\" he says. \"The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around. \"It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible.... and those stories help to light up the world.\" You get the idea. Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus. There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits. German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times. There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable. The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins. Highlights include one \"Joseph Carpenter\" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card. The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times. \"It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,\" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network. \"The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\" However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being \"too religious.\" After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language. The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah.

The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown \"severe and unusual behaviour\" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. \"It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order,\" he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. \"There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law,\" he said.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims. He said the inquiry was \"yet another process\" rather than progress towards helping people. Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry. He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend. Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug. \"He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,\" said Mr Findlay of the attack. \"Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.\" Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child \"tainted\" his adult life, including work and personal relationships. On the inquiry, he said: \"I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process. \"I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse. \"It is all very well saying'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.\" Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation. In a statement. Gordonstoun said: \"We welcome the Scottish Abuse Inquiry's invitation to submit a report and will respond in full. \"Cases of non-recent abuse must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and their families and the work that the Scottish Abuse Inquiry is undertaking will, we hope, draw important lessons from the past and make children safer in the future. \"For everyone at Gordonstoun today, making sure our students are happy, healthy and safe is at the heart of everything we do. \"We are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all our students. Our ongoing work in this area was recognised in our most recent independent Care Inspectorate Report which gave us a rating of five - 'very good' - for pupil care and support and noted the'comprehensive child protection procedures' in place.\" The Scottish government said it had established one of the widest ranging public inquiries that Scotland has ever seen into the abuse of children in care. A spokesperson said: \"It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them. \"We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors. \"Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse. \"We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of PS13.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.\" The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject. The spokesperson added: \"Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. \"Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?\" he said.

The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there.

They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria.\" He said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria.\" The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning.

The charity said there was a danger of some areas having no affordable homes. The government said it was committed to building 275,000 affordable new homes over the course of this parliament. Right to Buy was first introduced in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government and was given a boost in 2012 when discounts for tenants were increased to PS75,000. In this year's Queen's speech the government announced the scheme was being extended to 1.3m housing association tenants in England. Shelter, which looked at provisional figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government, said just two of the 166 councils in England listed as selling properties through Right to Buy had succeeded in replacing more than 100 of the properties sold. Under existing policy, the government has promised that each home sold after 2012 would be replaced.

But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: \"All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. \"While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience.\" The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration.

{"idx": 84, "text": "\"This is where it all happens,\" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. \"Jake Bugg has been here,\" he says. \"MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. \"Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal.\" The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. \"I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,\" he says. \"I've been in my own world and my own head. \"My engineer Ritchie said,'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' \"But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. \"That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends.\" You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a \"personality.\" On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. \"It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,\" he says. \"People were like,'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' \"Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level.\" Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. \"I got so many clothes I keep'em in my aunt's house,\" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. \"Eight years sitting on topHip-hop, grime, then I went pop.\" Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. \"I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,\" he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. \"Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,\" marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it \"was almost like the uninvited genre.\" He says: \"People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. \"I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else.\" He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: \"Black boys getting white paperFrom the underground, now we're in the skyscraper.\" Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. \"A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,\" he reflects. \"It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like,'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or,'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking,'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' \"But equally, they can tell you,'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like,'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' \"But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. \"So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else.\" Tinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.

Old Trafford was understandably exultant at the conclusion of such a carnival performance but Wenger now faces defining days of his Arsenal reign before the transfer window closes on Wednesday. For Wenger it was a performance, or lack of one, that proved the folly of his summer of transfer inaction Read more of the blog This result underscores the gulf that has opened up between United and Arsenal and Wenger will now seek to address the weaknesses in his squad and replace the departed Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. Ferguson's faith in the team that won so convincingly against Tottenham was rewarded with another thrilling attack-minded performance. Arsenal's uncertainty was partly explained by the unfamiliar make-up of their team, but the flaws were swiftly exposed by the manner in which United took the lead. Anderson's lofted pass was inventive but Arsenal's failure to react was ominous for what lay ahead, allowing Welbeck to head past Wojciech Szczesny. Van Persie then squandered an instant opportunity to equalise after referee Howard Webb awarded a penalty when Walcott tangled with Jonny Evans in the area. De Gea has had a mixed start to his Old Trafford career but he was engulfed by his team-mates as he dived to his right to make a fine save. And United ensured Arsenal were punished heavily as Young added the second after 28 minutes. Young found space just outside the area and curled a perfect finish high beyond Szczesny's grasp at the Stretford End. Welbeck's game was cut short by a hamstring injury - but there was no respite for Arsenal as Rooney worked a free-kick routine with Young to send a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner as the interval approached. Walcott halted some of United's momentum when he took advantage of slack marking to shoot beneath De Gea in first-half injury time. It made little difference amid the carnage of the second half as Arsenal were torn apart amid a torrent of goals, near misses and saves from the desperately exposed Szczesny. Arsenal survived until the 64th minute when they were undone by another piece of Rooney creation at a set-piece, again linking with Young before dispatching the finish past the motionless Arsenal keeper. It was the breaking point for Arsenal and they spent the remainder of game in a constant state of siege. Rooney was the creator for Nani with the pass that gave the Portuguese the opportunity to send a flamboyant chipped finish over Szczesny for United's fifth. Media playback is not supported on this device With the Gunners in disarray, Park marked his arrival as substitute by lashing home an unstoppable finish before Van Persie briefly interrupted the one-way flow towards Arsenal's goal by beating De Gea. It barely seemed possible for matters to get worse for Arsenal, but the agony increased when Jenkinson was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for fouling Javier Hernandez as he raced clear. Rooney completed his thrilling treble with a penalty eight minutes from time after Walcott fouled Patrice Evra. And United completed the scoring with their eighth in injury time, Young once again showing his eye for the spectacular with another curling shot. Wenger cut a despairing figure as he walked back to the dressing room at the final whistle after one of the darkest days of his career. Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.

The 44-year-old tried to cover up the killing and dispose of the weapon, a kitchen knife, by burying it in a garden, Teesside Crown Court heard. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told the mother-of-four she must serve a minimum of 14 years in prison.

It ended when Gowling lost her temper and stabbed Ms Walker in the chest. She then fled the house and tried to dispose of the knife. The court was told Ms Walker died as a result of massive blood loss. After the hearing, Det Supt Dave Ashton, of Durham Police, said: \"Our condolences go to the family of Charlie Walker who, since her death have shown nothing but dignity and courage. \"Ms Walker had a difficult life in many ways but the extreme act of violence which ended her life was not justified during an argument over a relatively trivial matter.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 91, "text": "Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. \"Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,\" Mr Haldane said. \"This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.\" Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as \"writhing in both agony and ecstasy.\" He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the \"reasons to be fearful\" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. \"If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,\" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5 against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was \"more unstable than it has been for some time.\" Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were \"a lot of global risks out there at the moment\" affecting the international economy. \"Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,\" Mr Osborne said. He added: \"I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border. \"The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.\" He said it was important to \"make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters.\" Earlier this month, Mr Osborne warned that the eurozone slowdown will impact UK economy.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Just over 60 of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19 said it would have a positive impact.

Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49 of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue. However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans. A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95 - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely.

{"idx": 101, "text": "The militants, who call themselves Sinai Province, posted pictures online of what looked like a missile followed by a large explosion on the ship. Egyptian officials said a coastguard vessel caught fire after a fire-fight with militants on the shore. The army said there were no casualties, contradicting the militants' claim. The incident happened in waters off the north Sinai town of Rafah, which neighbours the Gaza Strip. The SITE Intelligence Group carried a statement and pictures from Sinai Province which it said showed a guided anti-tank missile moments before it struck the vessel, and then the moment of impact. Witnesses said they saw other naval boats rushing to the scene to rescue those on board the burning vessel. It follows a wave of attacks on the Egyptian military by Sinai Province. Earlier this month, more than 100 people - including at least 17 soldiers - were killed in clashes after militants launched near-simultaneous raids on military checkpoints in Sheikh Zuweid and Rafah in Sinai. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Not surprisingly, there is a wide gap between the two versions reporting the maritime attack off the north coast of Sinai. IS - specifically their local affiliate called \"Sinai province\" - claim they fired a shore-to-ship missile at the craft and support this with photos on social media showing a massive fireball that would certainly have killed many crew and possibly destroyed the whole ship. Egypt officially denies there were any casualties, saying there was a fire-fight during which a coastguard boat was set on fire. Since anyone found contradicting official casualty figures there risks a 60,000 fine, it is likely that the truth lies somewhere between the two versions. Either way, this is a worrying development for shipping in the region. It comes just two weeks after a major battle between Egyptian forces and IS in Sinai, and it's clearly proving difficult to remove the militants and their growing arsenal from the area. Egypt has vowed to rid its Sinai Peninsula of the militants, and has had a state of emergency and a curfew in place since last October. Sinai Province was previously called Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Champions of Jerusalem), but announced a name change in November 2014 when it pledged allegiance to IS, the militant organisation that has taken over large parts of Iraq and Syria. The group has been on the rise since the military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013, and has killed at least 600 police and armed forces personnel since then.

{"idx": 102, "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Meg Lanning hit a composed 55 and Alyssa Healy a rapid 25 as Australia compiled 132-6 amid a mixed England fielding performance. In reply, Charlotte Edwards (31) and Tammy Beaumont (32) added 67 for the first wicket inside 10 overs. But, from there, England lost regular wickets to slump to 127-7. Australia - seeking a fourth straight title - will play New Zealand or West Indies in the final in Kolkata on Sunday. England, meanwhile, miss out on the final for the first time since 2010. Although they arrived at this semi-final having won all four of their group matches, England had already shown plenty of fragility with the bat, collapsing from 59-0 to 109-9 against West Indies and from 42-1 to 92-8 against India. This time, their middle-order woes finally cost them as they squandered the perfect platform laid by Edwards and Beaumont. With seven overs remaining, England needed 45 more with nine wickets in hand, but they succumbed to panic. First Beaumont played an unnecessary slog and was caught at cover, then Natalie Sciver was bowled third ball attempting an overambitious scoop, before Heather Knight smacked Erin Osborne to long-on. From there, England's hopes rested with the out-of-form Sarah Taylor, but her dismissal - caught behind tamely trying a reverse sweep - summed up England's muddled thinking and sealed their demise. After Healy and Elyse Villani got Australia off to a superb start with a partnership of 41 from 27 balls, the Southern Stars were in danger of faltering when both openers were dismissed in quick succession. Lanning came to the crease having passed 30 only once in four innings in the tournament, but the world's top-ranked T20 batter quickly set about demonstrating her class. Scoring heavily behind square on the off side, Lanning hit six fours, adding 36 with Ellyse Perry. As England came back into the game with late wickets, the Australia captain remained a serene presence at the other end - but she could not find any boundaries in the final four overs of the innings as Australia lost momentum. Media playback is not supported on this device It was a mixed performance in the field by England, containing both moments of magic and costly instances of ineptitude. In the closing overs, Sciver brilliantly ran out Alex Blackwell with a direct hit from deep midwicket, and Anya Shrubsole then accounted for Lanning with another superb piece of fielding, shattering the stumps from long-on. However, earlier Edwards' side had fluffed two straightforward run-out chances, with Lanning reprieved by a poor Danielle Wyatt throw and Blackwell surviving after a Shrubsole fumble. Media playback is not supported on this device Crucial runs were also conceded by poor ground fielding, with the whole haphazard display summed up by the comical moment when an inattentive Sciver was hit on the head by Katharine Brunt's throw as she walked back to her bowling mark. England captain Charlotte Edwards: \"I think we know a lot about each other and there are no secrets but Australia held their nerve and we didn't, and that is probably the difference. \"We didn't start particularly well with the ball but dragged it back and then started brilliantly with the bat and then lost our way. We showed glimpses towards the end of getting it back, but it wasn't quite meant to be.\" Australia captain Meg Lanning: \"We knew the powerplay would be crucial and with the start we got, we got ahead of the game. We knew it would be more difficult when the ball was softer so it was crucial we built on that momentum. \"We didn't start as well as we would like with the ball but we began to hit our lengths and the stumps.\" England coach Mark Robinson: \"It is a cruel game, another five runs then we were in a super over. Well done to Australia on the day \"There is a little stage fright and we were a little guilty of that in field, but we are not fit enough.

{"idx": 107, "text": "The materials, which can sense pressure as sensitively and quickly as human skin, have been outlined by two groups reporting in Nature Materials. The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The arrays are built into or under flexible rubber sheets that could be stretched into a variety of shapes. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects. They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery. In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet. Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top. The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow. The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin's performance. \"Javey's work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach. The heart of Professor Bao's devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group's skins with less layers. \"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News. \"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added. The overall flexibility of the Stanford group's skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group's approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed. Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high. Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques. John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials. \"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote. However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation,\" such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel,\" as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Mrs Gula has been accused of living in Pakistan on fake identity papers and faces up to 14 years in jail. Pakistan recently launched a crackdown on fake IDs. There are strict restrictions to getting a Pakistani ID card, which is needed for opening a bank account or to buy property. Why Now?: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Technically, Sharbat Gula cannot deny she committed fraud. But on a humanitarian level, many believe she is just one among thousands of Afghan refugees who committed the same offence. Unfortunately for Mrs Gula, she has become the victim of a rather sudden turn in Pakistan's policy towards refugees. It wants them out of the country in the shortest possible time. Pakistan's decision has come amid its rapidly deteriorating relations with India and Afghanistan. Officials say militants have been using hideouts in refugee settlements to launch attacks in Pakistan. Another reason, according to some quarters, may be Islamabad's likely desire to inflict economic pain on Kabul for co-operating with India. The Afghans forced to go home Afghanistan's looming refugee disaster Mrs Gula was arrested in Peshawar, near the Afghan border after a two-year investigation. She allegedly applied for an identity card in April 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi. On Sunday Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said she should be granted bail, but a judge denied her application, saying she had failed to make her case. If the fraud claims are true, she is one of thousands of Afghan refugees deploying desperate measures to avoid returning to their war-torn homeland. The celebrated \"Afghan girl\" picture was taken by photographer Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp in north-west Pakistan, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It led to one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. He tracked her down 17 years later, living in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. Mrs Gula later moved back to Pakistan and he kept in touch. He told BBC Newsday on Wednesday that he had hired a lawyer for her. He added that he believed the Pakistani authorities may have singled her out because she is so well known. \"Perhaps they are trying to send the message to other Afghan refugees that'we couldn't care who you are, we are going to hunt you down and drive you back into your country'.\" Recent UN figures show that Pakistan hosts 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees. A further one million unregistered refugees are believed to be in the country. Pakistan recently started cracking down on fake IDs. It has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s but the law was not enforced, says our reporter M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. At first, the procedure was for a village council member to endorse a citizen's application.

{"idx": 119, "text": "The seminars will be run by the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) in major English cities. New legislation passed this year places a statutory duty on schools and colleges to counter radicalisation. The seminars will be led by Kamal Hanif, head of Birmingham's Waverley School and an expert on Islam and citizenship. The union says the aim is to offer support and guidance to senior school leaders in the wake of high-profile cases such as that of the three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in February and are believed to be in the city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Islamic State. Their families later complained that police, the school and the local authority had failed to pass on information they said could have prevented the girls leaving. The Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015 requires educational establishments to prevent young people being drawn into terrorism. The seminars, in June and July, will help school and college leaders understand these duties and give them practical help and advice. The aim is to maintain an atmosphere of equality and diversity in schools but also to help teachers understand how social media can be used \"to groom young people into extremist ideologies,\" says the union. \"This is about having a greater understanding around the issues of radicalisation and extremism,\" said Mr Hanif. He said the seminars would help head teachers \"identify situations\" and \"deal with them in an appropriate manner, without overreacting and being alarmist. \"Young people spend a lot of their time on the web and social media and they can easily get drawn into extremist ideas without access to a counter-narrative. \"These seminars will help schools and, in turn, parents, who often have no idea that their children are accessing this sort of information, to pick up the signs, and use the appropriate channels in dealing with these concerns. \"They will help to equip heads with the counter-narratives to some of the false claims put out by extremists.\" Mr Hanif will be joined by the counter-extremism campaigner Sara Khan, co-founder of the counter-extremism and women's rights organisation Inspire and by ASCL's parliamentary specialist Anna Cole. Ms Khan said the seminars would clarify what schools were expected to do. \"Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of myth propagated about what the statutory requirements mean for both schools and pupils.\" Ms Cole said the aim was to avoid criminalising young people by helping schools intervene \"in the right way at an early stage.\" \"The key thing is to put in place proper risk assessments and have an open culture where different views and ideas can be discussed in an open way. \"We want to reassure schools that these steps will help them meet the statutory requirements and protect young people.\" The seminars in Bristol, Birmingham, Cambridge, London, Manchester, Leeds and Durham will be open to ASCL members and non-members.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 122, "text": "The pair appeared to spit at each other during Wednesday's Premier League game at St James' Park. Referee Anthony Taylor spoke to Evans and Cisse after the first-half incident, but neither was booked. The Football Association says it is waiting for Taylor's report before deciding whether any action is needed. Last season, George Boyd was given a three-match ban for spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. But from this season, FA disciplinary guidelines dictate that the penalty for such an offence is double that. Cisse's punishment could be even greater, given he was sent off for violent conduct in December for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman. FA guidelines indicate Cisse could receive an additional one-match ban. A number of ex-players believe Evans and Cisse should be punished. Former Newcastle midfielder Dietmar Hamann described the acts as \"not acceptable\" and \"disgusting,\" while former Manchester United defender Phil Neville added: \"Both those players will be embarrassed.\" Speaking on BBC's Match of the Day, Hamann added: \"There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis.\" Former Magpies midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I am completely disgusted. The game does not need to see this.\" Television replays appeared to show Evans spitting towards Cisse, who was on the ground. The Senegal forward then appeared to spit in the direction of Evans. Neither Newcastle manager John Carver nor Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal said they saw the incident. \"I can't comment on it,\" said Carver, whose side were beaten 1-0. \"I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line.\" Van Gaal said: \"I don't think Jonny Evans is a spitter.

{"idx": 126, "text": "Those killed included citizens from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland and Spain, PM Habib Essid said. Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed, he said. Security forces killed two gunmen and were searching the surrounding area for accomplices, Mr Essid added. At the time of the attack, deputies in the neighbouring parliamentary building were discussing anti-terrorism legislation. Parliament was evacuated. Following the attack, Mr Essid said: \"It is a critical moment in our history, and a defining moment for our future. \"We have not established the identity of the two terrorists.... Reports are not final, these two terrorists could have been assisted by two or three other operatives.\" Security operations were \"still under way,\" he added. According to Prime Minister Essid, 19 people were killed, although some of the countries involved have different totals: Earlier reports said that a total of 20 tourists had died, with at least 22 tourists and two Tunisians injured. Other reports suggest up to 50 could have been hurt. Italian, Polish, South African, French and Japanese tourists were among the injured, Mosaique FM radio reported. Parliament held an extraordinary session on Wednesday evening. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said: \"We are in a war against terrorism.... we will fight them without mercy.\" Analysis: BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Sadly, this attack did not come out of the blue. While Tunisia has been spared the catastrophic levels of violence that have plagued other Arab Spring countries like Syria, Yemen and Libya, the country has still suffered from occasional but deadly attacks carried out by Islamist extremists. In 2013, 22 people were killed. This included a suicide bomber who attacked a beach resort in Sousse. Last year 45 people were killed and already this year the death toll has reached 23, with Wednesday's museum raid following an attack on a mountain checkpoint in February that killed 4 police officers. In all cases the perpetrators are believed to be jihadists. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to Islamic State (IS) in Syria. More than 3,000 have joined, earning themselves a reputation for ferocity both on and off the battlefield. At the scene: BBC's Naveena Kottoor in Tunis The last group of foreign tourists left the Bardo museum by bus under the watch of the Tunisian security forces and hundreds of bystanders. Traffic is flowing again, but bystanders are still here. One man told me he had come out of sadness and shock. The attack struck at both the political and economic heart of Tunisia. The museum is to many Tunisians what the Louvre is to Paris - a major tourist destination. This kind of attack on civilians is new here - the last time something similar happened was in 2002. As an act of defiance and national unity, Tunisian politicians are returning to parliament on Wednesday evening. But many Tunisians had hoped that 2015 would bring a more prosperous and stable future. Tunisia's militant Islamists: How big a threat? Anti-terror demonstrations were reported in central Tunis on Wednesday, with crowds waving flags and condemning the attack. A museum employee told Reuters the two attackers \"opened fire on the tourists as they were getting off the buses before fleeing into the museum.\" Eyewitness Yasmine Ryan told the BBC she saw \"helicopters flying overhead\" and \"tanks rolling in\" as the security situation unfolded. The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry and its government, which only emerged at the end of a long political transition several months ago, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. Islamist militants have tried to derail the democratic transition, which, although fragile, remains the most positive result of the Arab Spring in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini offered her condolences (in French) to the victims' families, and said the EU would \"fully support Tunisia in the fight against terrorism.\" US Secretary of State John Kerry said the US \"stands with the Tunisian people at this difficult time\" and would continue to support the government's \"efforts to advance a secure, prosperous, and democratic Tunisia.\" Tourism is a key sector of Tunisia's economy, with large numbers of Europeans visiting the country's resorts. In 2002, 19 people, including 11 German tourists, were killed in a bomb blast at a synagogue in the resort of Djerba. Al-Qaeda said it had carried out that attack. Concerns about security in Tunisia have increased in recent months as neighbouring Libya has become increasingly unstable. A large number of Tunisians have also left to fight in Syria and Iraq, triggering worries that returning militants could carry out attacks at home.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 127, "text": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. \"I said to one:'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' \"He said:'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' \"So I said:'Well, bugger that. Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. \"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) \"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said. \"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\" Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. \"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper.... but under my name, not his.\" In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's PS5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than PS4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. \"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. \"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\" One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret,\" to his minister of defence. \"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? \"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\" And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in,\" a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. \"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said. \"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Orient edged the opening exchanges but lost defender Tom Parkes through injury before Steven Alzate was denied on the edge of the area by keeper Glenn Morris. Crawley had failed to score in their previous three home games but leading marksman James Collins swooped to give them the lead with his 20th goal of the season midway through the half. The former Shrewsbury striker struck by heading in a free-kick from Josh Payne and, although keeper Sam Sargeant got a hand to the ball, it flew into the corner of the net. Crawley took a firm grip of the game by scoring twice in the space of four minutes before the interval. Defender Joe McNerney rose unchallenged to head home a Payne free-kick from 12 yards on 29 minutes and then, from an Andre Blackman set-piece, Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn forced the ball home. Crawley, who had won only two of their previous 13 games, threatened again when a header from skipper Jimmy Smith was saved by Sargeant shortly after the break.

The North Carolina primary in particular was viewed as a test of the Republican establishment's ability to exert its influence on the nomination process and keep more divisive tea party candidates off the ballot in November. In the 2010 and 2012 election cycles, the Republican Party watched as popular tea party candidates won party primaries only to flame out in the general election because their strident rhetoric turned off independent voters.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The following day, 1 August, Laith became unwell with a fever and no appetite, but by 3 August he had recovered. Then, he took a turn for the worse. \"I tried to feed him, and that's when I realised something was still seriously wrong,\" Jude said. \"He chewed his food as usual but very quickly regurgitated it in chewed form.\" Jude took Laith back to hospital, where he was diagnosed with tonsillitis. \"I was given a local anaesthetic to spray at the back of Laith's throat 20 minutes before meals, to help him swallow,\" she said. \"Although I wasn't convinced, I tried the spray and Laith still struggled to swallow. \"I thought it best to give him a break from solids and started only giving him pureed soups and milkshakes. \"I continued to do this for two more days.\" But a few days later, after Laith regurgitated more food, Jude, who lives in New York, panicked. \"It happened shortly before bedtime,\" she said. \"And had he not regurgitated it then, it could have caused him to choke in his sleep. \"I decided to call his doctors in New York, as I had completely lost faith in the NHS. \"They told me to stop giving him solids completely as they are a serious choking hazard and only to give him liquids or stage-one pureed foods.\" The family travelled back to the US and went to a hospital in New York, where Laith was again X-rayed and seen by an ear, nose and throat specialist.

{"idx": 134, "text": "The package on offer from the government includes a pay rise and a reduction in the retirement age. The deal will now be put to a ballot of the union's membership. Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a \"surge\" in jail violence. They stopped work over claims of a \"surge in violence\" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest. Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits. Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5 and 1 for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases. They also stand to receive a \"recognition and retention\" package totalling PS1,000. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also \"agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons.\" The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down. It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England. In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured. And last month prisoners caused almost PS1m of damage during a riot at Bedford prison. Days later at HMP Isle of Wight, an inmate cut a prison officer's throat with a razor blade on the way back to his cell. In an effort to tackle safety issues Justice Secretary Liz Truss unveiled proposals detailing PS1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors. In response to the new pay deal she said: \"This agreement is a good offer which rightly recognises the hard work and dedication of officers across the country doing a tough job.\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 135, "text": "LGC Forensics, the biggest commercial provider, said the private sector was ready to take on the work of the FSS, but expressed concern that the forensics market was shrinking. The government announced last year that the FSS would close, with as many of its operations as possible being transferred or sold off. The government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40 of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS. But some experts are concerned that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science. The FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about PS2m a month. In a written submission to the inquiry, Steve Allen, the managing director of LGC Forensics, commented: \"The closure of the FSS will not damage the prospects for forensic science in the UK so long as its wind-down is properly implemented and is used by the government as an opportunity to support a properly regulated market of a sufficient size to enable competition between dedicated market participants.\" The Home Office has tasked the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) with managing the gradual wind down of the FSS. Written evidence from David Hartshorne and Roger Derbyshire, directors at commercial provider Cellmark, said there would be no negative impacts on the quality or impartiality of forensic evidence. \"Forensic scientists in the private sector have exactly the same motivation to support the criminal justice system and the victims of crime as those in the public sector,\" they said. Private sector scientists ethics and impartiality are independent of the organisation for whom they work; and ultimately, when they stand in the witness box to provide evidence, they are representing themselves rather than the company that employs them.\" In a written response to parliamentary questions on 1 February, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said advice from ACPO, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and others suggested that the UK forensics market would contract from PS170 million in 2009 towards about PS110 million by 2015. In addition, police forces have been bringing forensic work in-house, in order to make cost savings. And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market. Some forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS's closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (RD) once the service is closed down. In a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice. \"Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,\" he wrote. As reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government's aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness. He added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues. Mr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry. \"Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but.... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,\" the union wrote. It added: \"Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.\" Professor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was \"no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price.\" But he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated. \"It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,\" he wrote in his submission. \"Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.\" The FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control.

Columbus Day became a federal holiday in the United States in 1937 and celebrates the arrival of explorer Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492. The holiday falls on the second Monday of October. However, it has drawn significant opposition from those who regard Columbus's arrival as a prelude to centuries of oppression. A movement began in 1977 to replace it with a holiday that celebrates the indigenous peoples of North America. A few states now do not mark Columbus Day, or give it another title. Good Friday is one of the most important dates of the Christian faith, marking the day Jesus Christ was crucified by the Romans. It is not a federal holiday in the US but is a state holiday in some states.

Both recorders, known as the \"black boxes,\" are crucial to discovering why the Airbus A320 came down on 19 May, killing all 66 people on board. The plane was flying from Paris to Cairo when it vanished from radar. Investigators have said it is too early to rule out any causes for the crash, including terrorism. The Egyptian investigation committee said the data recorder had been \"retrieved in several pieces\" by a specialist ship, the John Lethbridge. The ship, operated by Deep Ocean Search, found the plane's wreckage on Wednesday in several locations about 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian coast, at a depth of about 3,000m (9,800ft). The data recorder is usually located in the plane's tail along with the voice recorder, which had to be salvaged in stages on Thursday because it was badly damaged. The investigation committee said the data from the second recorder's memory unit will be downloaded once it has been transferred to the Egyptian port of Alexandria. The data recorder gathers information about the plane's speed, altitude and direction. Earlier on Friday, an unnamed official in the investigation committee told AP news agency that the voice recorder's data was already being analysed by experts, including representatives of France's air safety agency and the plane's manufacturer, Airbus. The cause of the crash remains a mystery. Egypt's civil aviation minister has said a terrorist attack is more likely than a technical failure. Automated electronic messages sent by the plane revealed that smoke detectors went off in a toilet and in the avionics area below the cockpit, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. On Monday, the investigation committee confirmed that radar data showed the plane turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft) before it disappeared.

The team believes the footprints could be 3,000 to 4,000 years old. Staff and students from the University of Wales Trinity St David are carrying out the work. As well as the footprints, a line of post holes has been found, which could have been a causeway. They lie across an area that would have been salt marsh when the footprints were made. The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments is providing survey support, mapping the extent of the peat and other exposed features. Submerged forests have been found further north on the beach and nearby in the past. Dr Martin Bates is one of the archaeologists leading the excavation team, and it was his father, retired geologist Denis Bates, who discovered the footprints last month. Dr Bates told BBC Wales' news website: \"My father has had an interest in submerged forests for many years. \"He was down in February as this part of the beach was very clear. \"For various reasons the patterns of sand movement have been temporarily altered and it means this area of beach has been stripped of sand. \"He noticed the marks and told me they didn't look natural.\" He estimates they have a window of a few months to log the discoveries and take samples away for environmental testing before the sands shift again and cover the footprints up. \"In the context of Ceredigion and west Wales, it's the first time we have found this type of evidence. \"The submerged forests [nearby] are probably the most significant in the UK. \"What we have never had before is documented evidence of human habitation.\" 'Quite special' Dr Bates added that there were a range of footprints discovered, including cattle, sheep or goat and possibly a bear.

The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad represents an important military outpost between Poland and Lithuania with its coastline on the Baltic Sea. The accumulation of radars and air defence systems, as well as coastal anti-shipping missiles, all form part of Moscow's developing \"anti-access and area denial strategy,\" which in essence seeks to push Nato forces away from Russia and to make it very difficult to reinforce Nato members in the Baltic region in the event of a crisis.

Girls at the school can wear grey trousers, dark blue jackets and ties. But boys are not currently allowed to wear grey pleated skirts, although they would be under the new proposed dress code. \"We are asking them, should it be called uniform number one and uniform number two?,\" said head Adam Pettitt. He said the issue of a gender neutral uniform had come up during question and answer sessions with his A-Level students. This generation of young people was really questioning the binary way people look at things, he said. \"We're therefore exploring how our uniform policy could evolve to cater for those who do want to match clothing to gender, as well as those who don't.\" He added: \"In common with all other schools and youth organisations, yes, we are seeing greater numbers of pupils questioning gender identity than in the past. \"Having said that, in years gone by, absolutely no young people were raising it at all and it seems inconceivable that these sorts of questions simply didn't exist. \"The fact that there is significantly greater support and information available, both in schools and elsewhere, means that young people need no longer feel afraid to ask questions or speak out about their feelings. \"If they feel happier and more secure in who they are, it must be a good thing,\" he said.

{"idx": 147, "text": "Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year. But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report \"disingenuous.\" He said it was \"another example of fudging the facts.\" The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union. The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration. It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place. But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration? Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force? Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere? And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK? These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: \"It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.\" Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would \"continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future,\" he said. \"Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries,\" he said. \"Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.\" The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20 of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work. It said: \"This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000.\" The figures should not be taken as a \"precise estimate\" but were \"intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined,\" it said. There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded. Those who are \"self-sufficient\" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK. Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested. However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: \"Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market. \"The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.\" The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.

There will be five games left as the Premiership splits into two sections of six teams and the United manager does not rule out Hamilton Academical, who are four points ahead of Kilmarnock, being drawn into the relegation battle. \"It is still a comfortable cushion Kilmarnock have, but there is still a long way to go with plenty of points at stake,\" he said. \"We have certainly given ourselves a chance. \"It depends on how the teams above us do.

{"idx": 149, "text": "She outlined her concerns about the consequences of the Brexit vote in a letter to Theresa May on Wednesday. Mrs Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness highlighted five key priorities to the prime minister. On Thursday, Mrs Foster said: \"Brexit means Brexit, but that doesn't mean that we close our eyes to the challenges that are there.\" She emphasised that Northern Ireland's border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity, nor create an incentive for those who wished to undermine the peace process. \"In the past, terrorists have used the border as a way of evading justice and that can not be the case in the future,\" she said. \"We need to make sure that we have strong mechanisms in place to make sure that they don't get away with that sort of activity.\" In their letter, the first and deputy first ministers highlighted to Mrs May that Northern Ireland was unique as the only part of the UK that has a border with an EU member state. They also referred to costs, the energy market, drawdown of EU funding and treatment of the agri-food sector as other priorities. During the referendum, Mrs Foster's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) campaigned in favour of Brexit, while Martin McGuinness's Sinn Fein wanted to stay in the EU. When it comes to the economy, they said they wanted to \"retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states.\" \"It would be negligent of me not to point out where I believe the challenges are,\" Mrs Foster said. \"We're extracting ourselves from European Union and it is of course right that we identify where those challenges lie, but I fundamentally believe that there are huge opportunities.\" Speaking on Thursday, Mr McGuinness said the letter was \"a very important indication\" that he and Mrs Foster \"recognise our huge responsibility to the people we represent.\" \"I think we would've done a grave disservice if we hadn't articulated the differences and challenges we might face in times ahead,\" he said. \"This is about how we protect the interests of the people we represent and the challenges that lie ahead.\" He added that it was important the he and the first minister \"come together in the aftermath of the vote\" in spite of having been on different sides of the referendum debate. \"My gripe isn't with Arlene Foster, my gripe is with David Cameron who called the referendum in the first place,\" he said. \"This is too big, too serious for us not to be joined up in relation to how we take this process forward.\" Stormont's opposition parties criticised the letter, with the Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) economy spokesperson Steve Aiken asking \"whether this is a DUP u-turn on their position on the referendum.\" Mrs Foster replied that the UUP's position on Brexit had been \"comical.\" She added: \"Poor Steven Aiken has been sent out once again to be the attack dog against the executive, and frankly he comes across more as a Chihuahua.\" However, the SDLP's Claire Hanna said: \"The first minister has serious questions to answer over the breathtaking reverse ferret she is currently performing. \"Ms Foster has clearly realised the error of her ways in backing Brexit, and now the horse has bolted is asking the Conservative government to close the gate.\" While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU by 52 to 48, 56 of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 162, "text": "\"It was extraordinary to have found yourself a symbol of freedom of expression, though for the wrong reasons,\" the 73-year old Bogdanov tells the BBC World Service's Witness programme on the 30th anniversary of his trial. Accused of procuring an act of \"gross indecency\" likely to cause offence for his production of The Romans in Britain at London's National Theatre, Bogdanov says he felt \"enormous relief\" when the case collapsed and the prosecution withdrew its evidence on the third day of the hearing. He also says he felt \"very angry\" that the private prosecution brought by the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse had been allowed to happen at all. Mrs Whitehouse, he says, \"confused reality with an illusion\" on the stage. If he had been convicted, Bogdanov could have been jailed for up to three years. Written by the playwright Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, which opened in London in October 1980, was always likely to provoke controversy. With vivid imagery, strong language and violence, the play sought to draw graphic parallels between the Romans' invasion of the British Isles and the presence at the time of British soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland. But it was one short scene involving the attempted rape of a young Druid called Marban by a Roman soldier a metaphor for the rape of one culture by another,\" according to the director), that eventually landed Bogdanov in court. When he was first handed the play by the National's then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall, Bogdanov says he thought it contained some of the best new writing he had read. The attempted rape scene, to be performed with naked actors in full light and centre-stage, was \"brilliantly written.\" But though nudity was not uncommon on the stage - and Bogdanov was careful that no sexual contact was actually made between the actors (the Roman used his bunched up fist and thumb as a substitute for his erect penis) - Sir Peter was clearly worried. He asked Bogdanov to consider moving the scene upstage, in half light. The director stood his ground, arguing the scene's artistic merit. Sir Peter eventually acceded, but not before warning that there could be trouble ahead. Though playing to packed audiences, the play's nudity and strong language attracted fervent media attention. But more ominously, it quickly came to the notice of Mrs Whitehouse, then head of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association. She refused to attend a performance in person but in December 1980 sent her solicitor to watch the play in order to collect evidence. He came back convinced there had been a sexual act on stage likely to cause offence. Listen to the programme Download the podcast Having tried and failed to force the Attorney General to initiate a prosecution against the National, the morality campaigner then began her own proceedings under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, accusing Bogdanov of being the \"pimp\" who had allegedly procured the act on stage. Three decades on, Bogdanov's memories of those days are still vivid. He and his colleagues had initially dismissed the possibility of being taken to court, believing their defence of dramatic effect would be enough to discourage a prosecution. But a magistrate and then an Old Bailey judge both ruled that the case should be heard. Bogdanov became increasingly concerned: \"I can't pretend it was easy, it felt like some huge juggernaut rolling over me, especially when they spent hours discussing whether I should be kept in the cells overnight,\" he says. Anonymous letters arrived at the family home, while his children became the object of unwanted attention at school. \"At one point I was the only thing on the front pages.\" The collapse of Bogdanov's trial three days after it began was one more act in the long-running drama of The Romans in Britain. Keen to establish what Mrs Whitehouse's solicitor, and chief prosecution witness, had actually seen on stage, Bogdanov's defence team asked him to tell the jury where he had been sitting in the theatre. \"At the back,\" came the answer - much to everyone's amazement. Lord Hutchinson, lead defence counsel, leapt up: \"What if I told you that what you thought you saw was not an erect penis, but a thumb?\" And he proceeded to bunch up his fist and thumb under his robes, pulling them aside to reveal his hand to the witness and jury. Bogdanov, looking on from the dock, says members of the jury burst out laughing, while the prosecution barrister went pale and immediately requested an adjournment. The prosecution withdrew its evidence, and the court set Bodganov free. Outside the court, Mrs Whitehouse claimed victory. The case, she said, had set an important legal precedent that the Sexual Offences Act could be applied to events on stage and that simulated sex could amount to gross indecency. But for Bogdanov, the play that got him into trouble has left other lessons. The Romans in Britain, he says, is just one in a long line of stage productions down the years that have caused controversy. \"The thing that gives me most pleasure is that the theatre still has the power to shock,\" he says.

{"idx": 163, "text": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life. Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\" But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense. The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it. He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister. When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura. The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio. Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters. But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign. Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free. In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq. The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair. He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like.\" Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing.\" The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot.\" His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire. The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival. At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor. In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture. His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54 to 47. Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes,\" and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers. Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson. He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas. Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers. In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value. Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe. His latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The proposal leaves in doubt whether it could raise the nearly 6bn euros that was a central part of the bailout deal. And in a further indication of just how complicated this could become, the Cypriot Central Bank Governor Panicos Demetriades said he expected that 10 of deposits would be withdrawn when banks finally open. The Cypriot government appears to have decided against raising the levy on those with deposits of more than 100,000 euros to over 15. Here's the rub: The government fears this would effectively destroy its financial sector. Those wealthy Russians, who are the largest foreign investors, are likely to pull their funds out of the island if the one-off tax is too high. The Russians are angry and the Cypriot finance minister is heading to Moscow to explain. The Cypriots argue that the bailout would end up undermining a key sector of the economy. The suspicion in Nicosia is that it is precisely what countries like Germany want. They don't like tax havens for the wealthy. So how did Europe get itself into this tangle? As always Germany is the starting point. For Chancellor Angela Merkel there was a moral element to this. \"Anyone having their money in Cypriot banks,\" she said, \"must contribute to the Cypriot bailout.\" In other words it can't just be left to the taxpayers of other countries. The Cypriots say that the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was a strong proponent of taxing savers. At the talks the IMF also played tough. It insisted that Cypriot debt had to be sustainable and that meant reducing the size of the debt. So depositors were lined up to take a \"haircut\" - a slice from their savings. The Cypriots tried to hold out but they were faced with a veiled threat. The European Central Bank (ECB) might stop providing funds to Cyprus's two major banks. Without support, the banks would collapse and bankruptcy would follow. When the protests started, Mr Schaeuble tried to distance himself from what had been decided in Brussels. He told German TV that it was the European Commission and the ECB that had \"decided on this solution and must explain that to the Cypriot people.\" The Cypriots say it was the Germans who had pushed hard for the levy on depositors. Berlin says \"yes\" but not on small depositors. The arguments, no doubt, will continue. The legacy of this will be harder to forget. A suspicion will linger in places like Italy and Spain that, although European officials insist this was a one-off deal, depositors elsewhere might face a tax on their accounts. There will also be the suspicion that the finance ministers were willing to undermine the Europe-wide deposit insurance scheme with a sleight of hand. The episode also underlines again how much resentment is building in southern Europe towards the north and Germany in particular. Many of the protesters in Nicosia are openly antagonistic towards Angela Merkel and Berlin. There will be a question whether - as with previous bailouts - the measures adopted will damage the very economy they are intended to save. Cyprus reminds Europe how dangerous the eurozone crisis remains.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

The plane crashed 20 minutes after taking off from nearby Limoges as they flew to the south of France. The coroner, Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of accidental death. Andrew Cope, a senior Air Accident Investigation Board inspector, said an iPad navigation app may have prompted the pilot to make a sharp turn. Mr Cope told the inquest: \"I think the pilot, Andrew, probably realised he was in restricted air space and turned around. \"That's the point where things start to go awry and the flight path is quite dramatic from then on. \"The pilot has now realised he is descending and is manoeuvring the aircraft to get back up. \"The problem is that if that is done very quickly it puts a lot of pressure on the wings.\" Mr Cope agreed with the findings of French investigators who said the wings probably broke off when they came under too much pressure as Mr Hayes attempted to right the aircraft. Didier Pauliet, who works at a nearby school, said: \"The aircraft started losing bits. A wing fell off violently. \"Other bits, some bigger, started falling off. \"The rest of the plane fell in one piece almost immediately. We could see a lot of smoke.\" The inquest heard the single-engine Jabiru 450 had been heading to the southern French town of Rodez when it crashed into woodland.

{"idx": 170, "text": "But could some help to make you feel better? A recent report from the American Psychological Association (APA) described it as an area that's been \"largely untapped\" and holds \"great potential.\" Recently a number of games have been developed to raise awareness of mental health conditions and treat them. Take a look at some of them. Zoe Quinn came up with Depression Quest after online games helped her to deal with late night panic attacks. \"Being able to jump into this digital world for a while, and not be stir crazy, was actually super helpful,\" says the 26-year-old from Boston, Massachusetts. Text-based Depression Quest is designed as a realistic depiction of depression, rather than a form of treatment. In her game, players are asked to make day-to-day decisions as they negotiate life with depression. They will find more positive options \"crossed out\" and unavailable to select, depending on how low their character is feeling. It's been played around 700,000 times and will soon be available to a wider audience via the Steam website. Zoe's overwhelmed by the reaction, saying: \"We have one player who said they backed off suicide having played the game, which I can't even wrap my head around.\" She accepts it's hard for mainstream games to explore these issues in the same way. \"At the end of the day they still have to make their money. Trying to sell things that are personal and emotional is very difficult,\" she says. The 3D fantasy game SPARX was developed in New Zealand and tested on hundreds of teenagers and children. Results published in the British Medical Journal showed it reduced the symptoms of depression and anxiety, and in some cases was more effective than traditional therapy. An American firm, Linked Wellness, is planning to release SPARX in the US later this year. SPARX featured in a recent report for the American Psychological Association looking at gaming and mental health. Its author, Isabela Granic, says research in this area has been \"pitifully limited\" compared to the huge amount of research into the damaging effects of playing video games. This iPhone app claims its four simple tasks can help people suffering from stress, anxiety or depression to feel better. The developers say it is based on 10 years of research but the idea of \"training the brain\" is controversial. Developer Andre Konig told Newsbeat: \"We're not saying that this is a treatment that will get completely rid of your depression - but we're saying its a platform for you to better manage your condition, and do it in your own home.\" Lindsay Dobson helps young people deal with bereavement and terminal illness at East Cheshire Hospice. She's convinced of the benefits of gaming and uses it in her sessions. \"If they're feeling angry they might come in and go onto a game that's violent. If they're feeling really boxed in they might go onto Minecraft and build a tiny room and lock themselves in it,\" she says. \"They might say they've been on Second Life or World of Warcraft and they'll talk to me about what they've been doing on there. \"We explore the character they've chosen and why they've chosen to be that character.\" Lindsay admits some parents and other therapists are still very suspicious of the benefits of playing video games. \"It's never going to replace an actual real person sat with you listening to you, but it can help,\" she adds. Nate Smith suffered from depression as a student and played a lot of console games at the time. \"There were benefits because it was a good excuse to socialise and spend time with people,\" says the 24-year-old from south London. \"But it went the other way too as it was sometimes a good excuse to stay in my room. I remember spending hours alone in my room playing games, which did me no good whatsoever.\" Nate believes a game like SPARX may have helped him at the time and described Depression Quest as \"very authentic.\" \"You can see that if you do open up to people you'll be rewarded and the depression will start to lift. \"In 30 minutes you can learn a very valuable lesson and one that affects your decision making,\" he says.

The local authorities have refused to allow the book to be reprinted to prevent incitement of hatred, although the book was so widely printed during the war that it remained relatively easily available. Under European copyright law, the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work runs for the life of the author and for 70 years after his death - in Hitler's case on 30 April 1945, when he shot himself in his bunker in Berlin. Those rights cease on the first day of January 70 years after the author's death, and so publishers now have free access to the original text. However, German officials have said they will limit public access to the text amid fears that this could stir neo-Nazi sentiment.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}
{"idx": 190, "text": "Run by the National Trust, Dinefwr Park in Llandeilo is the only example of Brown's work in Wales currently open to the public. He was commissioned to design the gardens in 1775, by then owners George Rice and his wife Cecil, who was the only child of the fabulously wealthy William Talbot of Hensol in Glamorganshire. The socialite couple wished to emulate Brown's creations they had encountered at the homes of their friends in and around London, where they spent most of their time. National Trust Carmarthenshire general manager Jacqui Kedward said: \"What visitors to Dinefwr now see today is the vision of George and Cecil Rice with Brown's influence. \"Three hundred years on, Brown's influence is ever present and its splendour is something visitors still marvel at. Last year, we had record visitor numbers, many drawn mainly by the beauty of the landscape.\" Capability Brown was born in Northumberland in 1716 - although the exact date is unknown - the fifth son of a land agent and a chambermaid. Aged 16 he began work as a gardener on the Kirkharle Estate which his father managed. By 1739 he had moved south, and by 1742 his work - as apprentice to another prominent landscape gardener, William Kent - began to gain notoriety. Between 1750 and his death in 1783, Brown designed the grounds of more than 170 stately homes, including Blenheim Palace, Warwick Castle and parts of Kew Gardens. He served George III as royal gardener at Hampton Court, and each of his commissions were said to have earned him about PS500 (equivalent to PS61,000 in 2016). Created when Brown was almost 60, Dinefwr Park is typical of his naturalistic style, which drew praise and criticism in almost equal measure. Dinefwr's neat flowerbeds and tree-lined paths were ripped up in favour of his trademark undulating grasslands extending right to the house, irregular clumps of trees, and lakes created by damming small streams. Though seemingly George and Cecil Rice were not taken with all of Brown's suggestions, as a deer park garden and Gothic lodge at the entrance, shown in Brown's sketches, never made it into the finished project. The commemorative tree will be planted by National Trust director general Dame Helen Ghosh, on Friday, and events to mark the anniversary, including tours of Dinefwr Park's Capability Brown walk, will take place this year.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Ms Murphy, an independent left-wing TD, said Mr O'Brien was attempting to pay loans back at an interest rate of just over 1, when it was arguable that the correct rate should be over 7.

{"idx": 193, "text": "The United States team have repeatedly stated that beating the world number one would give them a boost of greater significance than the point they would put on the scoreboard. The theory follows that McIlroy should therefore be targeted in the draw, along with the talismanic Ian Poulter, who boasts an 80 winning record in his four Ryder Cups to date. \"They win a match against me, they get a point. No more, no less,\" McIlroy said. He was stating the obvious but there was an underlying message. Europe are not a one man team. There is strength in depth in Paul McGinley's side. Media playback is not supported on this device McIlroy and Poulter have dominated the build-up but there are two more figures just as likely to prove the engine room of the European effort. Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose have been somewhat under the radar but both have the form and experience to lead the way for the home team in Scotland. Garcia is playing his seventh Ryder Cup and has contributed 18 points from a possible 28 since making his first appearance in 1999. In that debut at Brookline he demonstrated a Tigger-like enthusiasm for these biennial jousts that has never dimmed. \"The drive to do well and obviously win, it's still the same,\" he said. \"Once you put your clothes on and your shoes on and you step on the first tee, you still want to beat them as hard as you can.\" In foursomes he's won eight of eleven matches while his dependable driving makes the Spaniard a huge asset in the fourballs. The world number three is in fine form as well; in his last eight tournaments he boasts five top 10 finishes, including three runner-up positions. \"We know how important the Ryder Cup is to all of us, how much it means to be part of this team; how difficult it is to be part of this team,\" Garcia added. It's conceivable the Spaniard could team up with McIlroy in the Friday morning fourballs, especially if McGinley decides to break up the world number one's partnership with Poulter. It was with McIlroy at his side at Medinah where Poulter unleashed his closing spell of Saturday evening birdies that began the remarkable European comeback from 10-4 down two years ago. Poulter could also pair up with his old mate Rose, but that's more likely to happen in the alternate shot format rather than Friday morning fourballs. Rose paired with Henrik Stenson looks a good match-up for the better ball format and the Englishman will feel ready to play a lead role. Oddly enough, this is only the third Ryder Cup for the 34-year-old and his first on home soil. Rose played in the defeat in 2008 and starred on the final day at Medinah two years ago. That extraordinary session feels like a lone day of success in his Ryder Cup career. \"Until that point we were being well and truly beaten,\" Rose told BBC Sport. \"And in the previous Ryder Cup at Valhalla we were on the losing end of it there. So I've experienced six days of Ryder Cup golf and five of them have been pretty bleak.\" But that tumultuous final day when the bleakness lifted proved the launch pad for Rose's career. His clutch putts on the final two holes to beat Phil Mickelson delivered a vital point for Europe but also provided a vital boost to the Englishman's self-assurance. It undoubtedly helped him win the US Open in 2013. \"I was surprised how comfortable I felt down the stretch at Merion,\" he admitted. \"That's due to all the experiences I've had in the game and a big part of that was Ryder Cup. \"As a kid you wonder how these guys stand up to the pressure and I'm not really sure how we do it, but you trust your training and you get into it. To be able to pull off some of the great shots I did down the stretch you have to take confidence from that.\" Rose is one of four major winners in the European team and the man who succeeded him as US Open champion, Martin Kaymer, is another. The German, who holed the putt that retained the trophy two years ago, could partner McIlroy in foursomes and is expected to play a much more senior role this time. He made only two appearances in the victory two years ago. Graeme McDowell is helping to shepherd Victor Dubuisson through his debut, while Lee Westwood is providing a similar role with the other rookies Stephen Gallacher and Jamie Donaldson. Despite their 2010 and 2012 victories, Europe are desperate to improve on a record in which they have won only two of the last nine sessions. McGinley's attention to detail should ensure they contend well in the foursomes and fourballs. But as Rose points out the opposition is strong. \"They've got a wonderful team,\" he said. \"I don't really buy into the whole underdog thing. The last two Ryder Cups have come down to just one point each time. It's going to be tight, I'm pretty sure of that.\" There are ready made partnerships in Tom Watson's side. Phil Mickelson (an unencumbered team leader in the absence of Tiger Woods) with Keegan Bradley, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson and Matt Kuchar partnering rookie Jordan Spieth look likely combinations. Media playback is not supported on this device The captain has re-introduced elements of Paul Azinger's successful pod-system from his victory in 2008 and vice captain Steve Stricker is a vital conduit between the team and their 65-year-old leader. If the match is close after the sequences for fourballs and foursomes are completed on Saturday night then it will come down to the singles and this is where Europe appear to have the edge. Sunday is the day when America is most likely to feel the absence of Woods as well as the injured Jason Dufner and the unavailable Dustin Johnson. They would surely have also liked to have had Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk in their ranks as well, but their play-off exploits came too late to convince Watson for wildcard picks. In the Sunday singles the experience and firepower of the likes of McIlroy, Poulter, Garcia, Rose and McDowell could well prove the difference for Europe.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know But a source close to Mr Fillon told AFP news agency that the candidate \"will not give up.\" The conservative Figaro newspaper said that Monday's speech would mark the start of a \"counter-offensive.\" Mr Fillon, a 62-year-old former prime minister, has denied wrongdoing and strongly defended his wife, Penelope. Last month Le Canard Enchaine newspaper reported that she earned 500,000 euros (534,000; PS428,000) as her husband's parliamentary assistant between 1998 and 2012, and questioned how much work she had done. The paper also said Mrs Fillon was paid 100,000 euros for little apparent work at a literary review owned by a billionaire friend of the family - an allegation that could lead to corruption charges against her husband. It subsequently emerged that Mr Fillon had hired two of his children to act as lawyers, paying them 84,000 euros between 2005 and 2007 - when they were students. Investigators have begun an inquiry into the reports. Mr Fillon said he would step down if placed under formal investigation.

{"idx": 197, "text": "The Saints boss had been linked with Rangers and Aberdeen in recent months. And the Perth club's chairman, Steve Brown, has spoken of his surprise that no other club has come in for Wright. \"I think he's worried about me coming into the last two years of my contract, that he's not going to get any compensation for me and that would panic him a bit,\" joked Wright, 53. \"I'm happy here. It is nice that you are linked with other jobs and so-called bigger clubs because that really means people realise the job you're doing here. \"That's the most important thing for me. I'm looking forward to this season, playing in Europe and doing well for St Johnstone.\" As it turned out, Pedro Caixinha took over from Mark Warburton at Ibrox and Derek McInnes has chosen to remain at Pittodrie, despite having discussions about the Sunderland vacancy, leaving Wright in charge at McDiarmid Park. In his four years at St Johnstone, and on a modest budget, he has guided them to the Scottish Cup, in 2014, and secured top-six finishes every season in the Premiership. Asked if he was surprised that his record had not led to approaches from other clubs, Wright told BBC Scotland: \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't, but it's not something that keeps me awake at night. \"It's not something that, if I see someone else getting a job, puts me in a bad mood. It's just the way it is and all I can do is keep doing my job here. \"I'm quite happy for the chairman to come and extend my contract at St Johnstone if he wants, but by the look of his comments he'd rather sell me and get a few quid in. \"I just have a simple way of looking at things - do the job to the best of your ability, do it well and whatever will happen will happen.\" Wright has been preparing his squad at Inverclyde Sports Centre in Largs for another crack at the Europa League, their reward for finishing fourth last term. Having lost Danny Swanson to newly promoted Hibernian and now defender Tam Scobbie to Scottish Championship club Dundee United, Wright is looking to strengthen his squad. He's in the process of clinching a deal to replace Swanson in time for the European signing deadline but the Scobbie departure has been a bit of a shock and it comes at a time when fellow defender Brian Easton is being treated for a groin problem. \"There is a risk Brian may miss Europe and that certainly leaves us short in terms of a left-back,\" said the Northern Irishman. \"I wanted Thomas {Scobbie} re-signed. I know he was more than happy to stay, but something's happened that it's fallen through so I've got to deal with that. \"It's part of management, you don't always get what you want and now we've got to move on and do the best for the club. I'm now putting all my efforts in to get a left-back to be cover for losing Thomas.\" Wright drew praise for his handling of the infamous New Douglas Park brawl between Swanson and team-mate Richard Foster as they left the pitch at half-time in the match with Hamilton. But the manager says that incident on 1 April was one of the toughest tests of his managerial career. \"I didn't see it and still haven't seen it because there's no footage of it, which is a miracle these days,\" he said. \"Immediately after the game, when I'm hearing what's allegedly happened, there was one thought in my head: that the two of them can go, they're out, they're sacked. \"But then it was time for calm heads and leadership from the club and myself. The lads very quickly helped the situation by admitting they were wrong, they were remorseful. \"So come the Saturday night they definitely weren't going to be sacked, but the chairman and I felt that for the image of the club we'd deal with this as severely and as quickly as we could (with a fine and reprimand). \"We were honest with the players, in terms of how we felt they had let not only themselves down, but the club and Scottish football as a whole. \"The timing of it could have derailed our season. We actually lost the game 1-0, losing a goal in the 91st minute after doing brilliantly with nine men and that was gut-wrenching for the players.\" Wright feels that by beating Hearts with a weakened squad and then Inverness in Saints' next two games, it showed the benefit of \"having good people and a good squad.\" On Monday, St Johnstone will find out who they will face in the first qualifying round of the Europa League.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 202, "text": "This is demonstrably false. Far-right parties failed to pass a 5 barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a \"Belarusian neo-Nazi.\" The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his \"courageous and selfless service.\" The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal \"is to prepare for a race war.\" Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. \"Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship,\" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services. Nevertheless, the fact is, neo-Nazis are indeed a fixture in Ukraine's new political landscape, albeit in small numbers. As Mr Korotkykh's case demonstrates, the ultra-nationalists have proven to be effective and dedicated fighters in the brutal war in the east against Russian-backed separatists and Russian forces, whose numbers also include a large contingent from Russia's far right. As a result, they have achieved a level of acceptance, even though most Ukrainians are unfamiliar with their actual beliefs. The volunteer Azov Battalion is a case in point. Run by the extremist Patriot of Ukraine organisation, which considers Jews and other minorities \"sub-human\" and calls for a white, Christian crusade against them, it sports three Nazi symbols on its insignia: a modified Wolf's Hook, a black sun (or \"Hakensonne and the title Black Corps, which was used by the Waffen SS. Azov is just one of more than 50 volunteer groups fighting in the east, the vast majority of which are not extremist, yet it seems to enjoy special backing from some top officials: Ukraine's media have been noticeably silent on this subject. Recently, prominent newspaper and online publication Left Bank published an extensive interview with Mr Troyan, in which the journalists asked no questions at all about his neo-Nazi past or political views. And after the Unian news agency reported the presidential ceremony under the headline, \"Poroshenko awarded Belarusian neo-Nazi with Ukrainian passport,\" it was soon replaced with an article that air-brushed out the accusations of extremism. Unian's editors have declined to comment on the two pieces. There are significant risks to this silence. Experts say the Azov Battalion, which has been widely reported on in the West, has damaged Ukraine's image and bolsters Russia's information campaign. And although Ukraine is emphatically not run by fascists, far-right extremists seem to be making inroads by other means, as in the country's police department.

Among SNP sources, the chatter was that she would give an ultimatum to Theresa May that if she could not negotiate a differentiated Brexit deal for Scotland she would push for a second independence referendum. Forget that. Scotland's first minister has gone the whole hog, saying she will next week push the button on a second independence referendum by putting legislation to the Scottish Parliament. Sturgeon can probably win that in Holyrood, but can she win the referendum? Her announcement will delight her many many supporters. She is undoubtedly a hugely effective and talented politician. During the last referendum, the SNP's support grew very significantly and they managed to enthuse many thousands of new members to their cause. But does the SNP have an updated economic argument? Is she willing to risk rancour from many Scottish voters who want another referendum like a hole in the head? As I've written before, the UK and Holyrood governments are set for a battle royal over timing of a potential vote. But the question first is whether or not the prime minister is willing to grant a vote. Under the law, Westminster has to grant the referendum; it's not just down to the Scottish government. I'm told Number 10 had carefully worked out \"countermoves\" depending on what the first minister's message was this week. Now Sturgeon has made the first big move, it's down to the other side to respond. But arguably we have just entered into the most complicated, most fraught, most fundamental period of political uncertainty for our country in a very long time. Sturgeon's announcement confirms that it is not just our place in the EU that is changing, but the relationships between our own nations that are at question too.", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "en"}

{"idx": 269, "text": "国家资产管理局（Nama）是爱尔兰共和国的“坏账银行”，旨在处理2008年房地产崩盘后的不良贷款。在现金被转移到马恩岛的一个银行账户后，英国国家犯罪局（NCA）正在调查纳马在北爱尔兰的交易。交易各方否认有不当行为。北爱尔兰第一部长彼得·罗宾逊与总部位于加利福尼亚州的全球投资公司PIMCO举行了斯托蒙特会议。它有兴趣购买Nama的北爱尔兰贷款组合。Frank Cushnahan当时是Nama NI咨询委员会的成员，Ian Coulter当时是贝尔法斯特Tughans律师事务所的管理合伙人，也出席了会议。北爱尔兰时任财政部长Sammy Wilson向爱尔兰政府表示，美国律师事务所Brown Rudnick的两名客户有兴趣收购该投资组合。PIMCO就是其中之一。爱尔兰财政部长Michael Noonan回复Sammy Wilson说，感兴趣的买家应该联系Nama。努南明确表示，任何出售都必须在公开市场上进行。Frank Cushnahan因个人原因辞去Nama北爱尔兰咨询委员会的职务。美国投资公司PIMCO提交了对北爱尔兰投资组合的投标书。它希望达成一项交易，这意味着投资组合不会在公开市场上进行，从而吸引其他潜在买家。然而，Nama决定必须将其出售给出价最高的投标人。Nama任命了一家国际银行来吸引人们对其北爱尔兰投资组合拍卖的兴趣，该拍卖被称为“鹰计划”。包括太平洋投资管理公司在内的九家公司已被接洽。当PIMCO最终确定其投标时，它发现了一项费用安排，涉及其律师Brown Rudnick、Ian Coulter和Frank Cushnahan之间的1500万PS。PIMCO让Nama意识到其担忧并退出。然后，律师们将他们的服务转移给另一个投标人Cerberus Capital Management。Cerberus的代表，包括美国前副总统Dan Quayle，在斯托蒙特会见了Peter Robinson。最终，只有两家公司提出收购Nama的北爱尔兰贷款组合。纽约投资基金Cerberus提出了12.4亿PSB的最高出价，比最低底价高出一小部分，并被接受。Fortress的另一个报价是11亿PSG，低于储备。图格汉斯的管理合伙人伊恩·库尔特（Ian Coulter）因当时被称为“内部事务”而辞去了贝尔法斯特律师事务所的职务。来自韦克斯福德郡的独立政治家米克·华莱士（Mick Wallace）告诉爱尔兰议会（Dail），向图格汉斯支付的750万PSK费用已转移到马恩岛的一个银行账户，据报道是为了方便向北爱尔兰政治家或政党付款。作为回应，Tughans证实Coulter先生在其不知情的情况下转移了资金，但补充说，它已经收回了资金。Coulter表示，任何政客都不会从中受益。由英国国家犯罪局牵头的警方调查开始了。斯托蒙特的财务委员会也开始对这笔交易进行调查。库什纳汉强烈否认有任何不当行为。忠诚的博客作者Jamie Bryson向斯托蒙特的财务委员会提供证据。他利用特权声称，五名交易撮合者本应分享马恩岛的资金。Bryson先生声称他们是Peter Robinson、Frank Cushnahan、Ian Coulter、Andrew Creighton（开发商）和David Watters（会计师）。罗宾逊表示，这一说法“毫无证据”。克雷顿和沃特斯也对此予以否认。第一部长彼得·罗宾逊出现在财务委员会面前，再次拒绝接受他将从纳马协议中获得经济利益的说法。他告诉MLA，“为了经济的最大利益”，他有动机与感兴趣的买家会面。他反驳了副第一部长马丁·麦吉尼斯对这笔交易一无所知的说法。前财政部长Sammy Wilson将斯托蒙特调查描述为“米老鼠演习”。他指责调查“无能且有偏见”，并表示调查没有将虚构和偏见与事实区分开来。议会财务委员会前新芬党主席Daithi McKay辞去MLA职务，此前泄露的推特消息显示，他在Jamie Bryson出席委员会之前“指导”了他。泄露给英国广播公司的推特消息显示，2015年9月17日，麦凯先生直接向布莱森先生发送了一条消息，告诉他关注新芬党成员托马斯·奥哈拉的推特账户。第二天，奥哈拉在推特上直接发了一条信息，告诉告诉：“你可能只有10-15秒的时间，主席Daithi必须拉你，所以把你在这件事上的最佳得分挤到1-2行，然后直截了当地说出来。”他发来的另一条信息说：“如果可以的话，尽量简短，当它被说出来的时候，它是有特权的。它将是一个伟大的终结者。”McKay先生说他的行为“不恰当、不明智和错误的”，但否认指导布赖森先生。新芬党暂停托马斯·奥哈拉的职务。杰米·布莱森表示，他不会参与任何调查。他说：“我不会配合任何调查，调查我与谁交谈，我的消息来源是谁：他们可以先把我关进监狱。”。接下来的一周，财政委员会成员呼吁财政部长Mairtin O Muilleoir在调查推特交易时靠边站。O Muilleoir先生在Bryson先生作证时是委员会的新芬党成员，并在Brysson先生和O'Hara先生的推特交流中被点名。副第一部长Martin McGuinness坚持认为O Muilleoir先生将继续留任。BBC Spotlight NI的一项调查显示，Frank Cushnahan被记录接受了一名Nama借款人的40000 PS4现金付款。这段录音制作于2012年，当时库什纳汉仍在担任纳马的顾问。这笔款项是唐郡房地产开发商John Miskelly在医院停车场的一次会议上支付的。Miskelly先生说“我向任何人支付的款项都是合法的。”Cushnahan先生否认有任何不当行为，并告诉Spotlight，由于国家犯罪局（NCA）正在进行调查，他不会提供任何进一步的回应。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 273, "text": "浮冰的冬季覆盖率大大降低，进入了最温暖的月份，低于2012年这一有史以来卫星观测的最低年份。但雷丁研究小组表示，目前的冰层范围实际上并不能很好地反映9月最终低点的规模。一个更好的相关性是5月份浮冰上有融化池的比例，这一指标表明2016年不会是创纪录的一年。积水通过改变白冰的反射率或反照率来加速融化。较暗的液体从太阳吸收更多的能量，促进进一步融化和更大比例的积水。。。然而，尽管北极冬季出现了一些显著的条件，但在未来几周内，这种反馈过程并没有在正确的地点和正确的时间成为真正抑制海冰的主导因素，国家海洋研究中心极地观测与建模中心的David Schroeder博士认为。“考虑到整个冬季的融化程度有多低，再加上强烈的海面温度异常，2016年看起来肯定是一个有趣的一年。但冬季并不是融化池开始形成的月份；这种情况发生在5月下半月和6月初。在这段时间里，尽管一些地方仍然存在正异常，但在融化池比例最重要的地区，例如东西伯利亚海到北极中部，温度并不是很高。”CPOM团队开发了一个模型来预测北极融化池的演变，并将其纳入了一个更通用的气候海冰模型中。它的模拟表明，到今年夏末，海冰面积将达到450万平方公里。这个数字是整个9月的平均值，传统上是覆盖范围最小的时期。这比去年（460万平方公里）略低，但比2012年9月的浮冰退缩到360万平方公里时的情况要大。过去的预测显示出了很高的技巧。2014年的情况相当不错；2015年的数据有点高，但只是在误差范围的边缘。同事Daniel Feltham教授表示：“天气状况仍然存在不可减少的不确定性。”。“我们无法预测每年发生的大气混乱，这从根本上限制了我们对北极冰盖的预测。”为了说明这一点，2012年8月初，一场强烈的风暴在北冰洋中部上空爆发。这给夏季融化季节带来了额外的刺激。类似的事情今年很容易再次发生。雷丁的展望刚刚提交给海冰预测网络（SIPN），这是一个面向科学和利益相关者团体的社区论坛，旨在比较和改进预测工具。这些团体都有自己的观点，预计SIPN将在未来几天在网上发布他们的个人预测。美国国家航空航天局的Walter Meier博士是SIPN的领导团队成员。他告诉BBC新闻：“我想说，我们正处于这样一个阶段，我们正在研究人们的不同方法，研究他们的表现，试图理解为什么以及他们是如何把事情做对或做错的，然后希望能找出这对未来改善预报的影响。”做出季节性预报是一个非常困难的问题，因为在9月之前的三到四个月里，可能会发生很多与天气有关的事情：有多少太阳和多少云；温度；风，以及风向。风是为了把冰压缩在一起还是为了把冰散开？他们会把冰吹到温暖的水中融化吗？这真的很艰难。“毫无疑问，拥有更好的海冰预测模型对许多行业都很有用。航运、旅游和石油行业都在寻求利用北极出现的机会，因为在气候变暖的情况下，北极将变得更加开放。”对许多利益相关者来说，他们对总的冰量不太感兴趣；相反，他们对自己所在的冰量感兴趣。因此，感兴趣的是空间变化，这也是我们正在研究的问题，并希望在未来改进，”Feltham教授说。并在推特上关注我：BBCAmos", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 296, "text": "中红外仪器（Miri）将收集90亿英镑（55亿英镑）天文台试图识别宇宙中第一颗星光的关键数据。在英国卢瑟福-阿普尔顿实验室进行的测试结果刚刚签署，米丽可以前往美国。詹姆斯·韦伯被视为哈勃的继任者，将于2018年发射。它将携带一个6.5米的主镜（是哈勃主镜宽度的两倍多）和一个网球场大小的防护罩，以保护其敏感的视觉免受太阳的热量和强光的影响。该天文台的任务是追踪宇宙中最早的发光物体——第一代爆发生命的恒星群。为了做到这一点，韦布将使用其红外探测器比哈勃望远镜更深入地观察太空，并追溯到130多亿年前的一个时期。Miri的英国首席研究员Gillian Wright教授解释道：“James Webb上的其他仪器将对天空进行大规模调查，寻找这些非常罕见的物体；他们将找到候选者。”。“但米丽扮演着一个非常特殊的角色，因为它将是观察这些候选者的工具，以确定其中哪一个是真正的第一光物体。只有米丽才能给我们这个确认，”她告诉BBC新闻。JWST是美国（Nasa）、欧洲（Esa）和加拿大（CSA）航天机构之间的合作项目。欧洲正在提供该望远镜四个仪器中的两个，以及将其送入轨道的阿丽亚娜火箭。和平号可以说是四种仪器中用途最广泛的一种，其可探测波长范围比同行（5-28微米）宽得多。从根本上讲，这是一个可以拍摄宇宙照片的相机系统。但它也携带了一个日冕仪来阻挡明亮物体的光线，这样它就可以更容易地看到附近较暗的目标，比如围绕恒星旋转的行星。此外，还有一台摄谱仪，可以将光分为不同的颜色，这样科学家就可以分辨出遥远现象的化学成分。Miri是一个复杂的设计，将在零下266摄氏度下运行。这种寒冷的状态是仪器的探测器对最微弱的红外源进行采样所必需的。必须尽一切努力确保望远镜自身的热能不会淹没它所追求的信号。Miri的硬件由来自欧洲和美国的机构和公司开发。将每一件物品组装在一起并组装完成的系统的工作在英国具有科学和工程领先地位。Miri刚刚在牛津郡的Rutherford Appleton实验室（RAL）进行了严格的机械和热测试。这包括摇晃仪器，以模拟它在阿丽亚娜号上升到轨道时会受到的撞击。它还被放在一个真空室中，并受到它在太空中所经历的那种温度的影响。负责此次测试活动的RAL工程师Paul Eccleston说：“能在Miri上工作真是一种荣幸，很高兴看到它最终问世。”。“可以说，当我们把它放在火箭顶部，点燃蓝色的触摸纸，看着它进入太空时，这将是非常令人兴奋的。”签署测试结果的文件现已被美国国家航空航天局接受。下一步是将“米里”号放入一个特殊的环境控制的运输箱中，这样它就可以前往美国航天局的戈达德中心。詹姆斯·韦伯的最终整合将在马里兰州工厂进行。Miri将被固定在一个名为综合科学仪器模块的笼状结构内，并位于大镜子后面。到2018年，我们将迎来更多的测试。16年前，JWST被推荐为哈勃望远镜之外的逻辑进化，它成功地引起了相当多的争议。技术困难和项目管理不善意味着天文台现在比计划晚了几年运行，超出预算数十亿美元。去年夏天，美国国会议员希望取消该望远镜。这并没有发生，但国会山现在对詹姆斯·韦伯的约束非常严格，美国国家航空航天局被要求每月更新已达到或未达到的里程碑。围绕詹姆斯·韦伯的很多讨论往往集中在成本上。美方目前的估计为88亿美元，涵盖了该项目从开始到初始运营结束的整个生命周期。除此之外，还有约6.5亿欧元用于Miri和Ariane等欧洲捐款。埃里克·史密斯博士是美国国家航空航天局詹姆斯·韦伯项目的副主任。他相信纳税人确实很欣赏这项投资。他告诉BBC新闻：“当你能够向人们展示詹姆斯·韦伯会做一些甚至哈勃望远镜都做不到的事情时，他们就会理解。”。“人们认识到哈勃望远镜是多么具有标志性，它对他们的生活产生了多大的影响。”哈勃望远镜返回的图像和科学结果渗透到了流行文化中。韦布的照片也同样清晰，但因为望远镜将观察光谱的不同部分，它将向我们展示全新的东西。\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 298, "text": "生物学家研究了澳大利亚东海岸附近的一群悉尼章鱼，并观察到了一系列可能表明复杂社会信号的行为。站得高高的、变黑的、以“Nosferatu姿势”张开网的章鱼很可能表现出攻击性。相反，章鱼在打架失败后或试图避免冲突时可能会表现出苍白的颜色。以前人们认为章鱼在很大程度上是孤独的生物。身体颜色和其他行为的改变被解释为躲避捕食者的策略。但彼得·戈弗雷·史密斯教授表示，这项独特的研究基于53小时的录像，于周五发表在《当代生物学》杂志上，为章鱼的行为提供了一个新的视角。该报告的合著者Godfrey Smith教授说：“一只好斗的章鱼会变得很黑，站立的方式会突出它的体型，而且它经常会试图站在更高的位置。很明显，这种不寻常的姿势不是生理反应。”。它让它看起来尽可能大，手臂展开在下面，斗篷，动物的背部，举过头顶。“深色是与那些强调体型的行为一致产生的。黑暗与攻击性没有特别的生理原因，但它确实给人一种更大物体的印象。”澳大利亚和美国的研究人员将这种姿势称为“诺斯费拉图姿势”，指的是20世纪20年代的经典恐怖电影，因为章鱼网的传播让人想起吸血鬼的斗篷。章鱼在躲避侵略者时经常脸色苍白，还产生了被称为神格显示的高对比度图案。当章鱼被迫离开巢穴后，或在有攻击性的个体在场的情况下，试图返回巢穴时，最常观察到这种对比模式。戈弗雷·史密斯教授说：“假设那里有一个高大、好斗的家伙，你想回到我们的巢穴，如果你脸色苍白地靠近，这可能被解释为非对抗性行为。”。研究还发现，如果距离很近，两只颜色较深的章鱼很可能会打架，而一只颜色较暗的章鱼可能会站在浅色章鱼的对面。另一种头足类动物墨鱼也表现出类似的特征，好斗的雄性会变黑脸，苍白的雄性会退出打斗。悉尼南部杰维斯湾附近的群落中生活在一起的章鱼数量异常之多，这使得人们能够比以前更深入地观察相互作用。Godfrey Smith教授的合著者David Scheel和他的学生梳理了53个小时的视频，观察了186只章鱼之间的互动。这包括Nosferatu姿势，以及伸手、抓握和交配。戈弗雷·史密斯教授说，观看这些长视频“比我预期的要累得多”。“每分钟识别一只章鱼都很困难，因为它们会改变颜色和形状。”如果章鱼偏离了画面，你就无能为力了。”", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 304, "text": "前几周，当我遇到我的朋友Kerrie，问她为什么吐司上有幸福的味道时，情况确实如此。“布兰妮·斯皮尔斯的午夜幻想，”她回答。现在，我显然很欣赏布兰妮作为流行音乐的皇室成员，但我很惊讶这样一种引人注目的香水会附上名人的名字。不久前，香水还与拉尔夫·劳伦等知名时尚品牌或香奈儿等高级定制品牌联系在一起。但在过去十年里，市场上名人香水的数量激增。为什么？詹妮弗·洛佩兹。《纽约时报》前气味评论家、几本关于这个主题的书的作者Chandler Burr说：“Glow改变了一切。”。他认为洛佩兹的第一款香水于2002年发布，引发了除臭剂的泛滥。他说：“伊丽莎白·泰勒是第一批（拥有自己香水的）人之一，但Glow把整个事情搞得一团糟。”。洛佩兹引发了杰泽贝尔精彩地描述的“气味瀑布”。突然间，每个人和他们的金鱼都有了自己的气味。他们按卡车销售。The Perfume Shop的董事总经理Gill Smith说：“当名人的面孔与观众产生共鸣时，品牌的销售额和知名度就会大幅上升。”。她引用碧昂斯和爱莉安娜·格兰德的系列产品作为该店最受欢迎的产品之一。那么，名人香水的吸引力是什么呢？“认同感和亲密感，”伯尔说。“香水是明星的一个负担得起的单位。假设名人真的参与了香水的创作，那么香水就构成了与明星发自内心、亲密的认同。在某种程度上，它就是与他们的相遇。”香水理想情况下必须与名人的形象相匹配，同时也要吸引他们的核心观众（这就解释了为什么拥有年轻粉丝群的流行明星会有带有甜味的香水）。史密斯说：“我们仍然渴望更像我们的偶像，通过香水建立联系是实现这一目标的一种方式。”布兰妮·斯皮尔斯经受住了时间的考验。12年前曾穿过Britney Fantasy香水的铁杆粉丝们现在仍在来我们这里尝试她的新香水。“这可能是我忏悔的好时机。在我开始之前，这不是我感到骄傲的事情，好吗？那是2014年8月。”。我去西班牙度假，当时在巴塞罗那机场的免税区。早些时候，我很无聊，想把最后一笔欧元拿出来，当时我正在胳膊上下喷洒各种须后水，突然有一滴流到了我的鼻子上。我看了看瓶子，惊讶地发现它是安东尼奥·班德拉斯的《秘密》。所以我买了它，并因花钱买了安东尼奥·班德拉斯的《秘密》而受到朋友们的嘲笑。但它确实让我意识到，如果某种东西闻起来很香，它无论如何都会卖出去。对于那些不想以自己的名义发布香水的名人来说，仅仅是为现有品牌代言的行为就可能产生巨大的影响。史密斯说：“约翰尼·德普作为迪奥·索瓦奇的代言人，有助于提高人们对这种香水的认识。”。“推出18个月后，它仍然是我们每天销售额前十的产品之一。”其他例子包括Gigi Hadid和Tommy Girl；贾里德·莱托与古驰；以及与肯德尔·詹纳合作的雅诗兰黛现代缪斯。她补充道：“最近，娇兰宣布与安吉丽娜·朱莉合作，这让一家更传统的香水店名声大噪。“在过去的几年里，名人香水的耻辱感可能已经消退，但现在销量也在消退。这种下降始于几年前的美国。”伯尔解释道：“我们在2008年股市崩盘后就看到了这种情况，现在美国行业已经确定，名人市场已经崩溃，或者至少大幅缩水。蕾哈娜和其他一些人的香水都做得很好，但与以前完全不同。”。“英国的消费者似乎也对他们嗤之以鼻。市场研究组织National Purchase Diary（NPD）发布的数据显示，去年英国名人香水的销售额下降了1200万英镑，下降了22英镑。但香水市场整体实际上增长了1.4——所以这并不是说人们停止购买香水，只是他们对名人的吸引力降低了。看看普拉达、香奈儿和迪奥等高级定制品牌的销售额，它们去年的销售额总共增长了6。NPD英国美容高级客户经理Teresa Fisher表示：“名人香水的下降是我们在过去两年中注意到的，这不是我们通常看到的。”。她指出，下降的部分原因可能是发射次数减少。费舍尔说：“几年前市场非常健康，因为周围有很多名人香水。”。“我们看到单向香水和詹姆斯·邦德香水带来了市场增长，但现在我们没有看到那么多名人推出。”货架上的名人古龙香水可能会减少（对不起），但史密斯表示，市场仍然强劲。她说：“这绝对不是名人香水的终结，我们仍然相信他们在市场上有一席之地。”。“顾客仍然想要名人香水，只要它是合适的名人和合适的香水。”当然，合适的香水是至关重要的部分。当伯尔还是《纽约时报》的气味评论家时，他曾给布兰妮的《午夜幻想》评过四颗星，这是出了名的，他暗示，如果气味本身很好，就不应该对名人感到势利。他引用莎拉·杰西卡·帕克的《Lovely》作为他遇到的最好的名人香水之一，现在甚至正在开发自己的香水，名为《You or Someone Like You》。费舍尔说：“我认为总的来说，我们看到的是香水市场的两极分化。”一方面，消费者追求物有所值，他们追求促销，也许还有名人香水。但另一方面，消费者变得更加挑剔。“与其一年买10次，不如一年买5次。他们花了同样的钱，但却转向了更小众或更高级的产品。”去年，英国香水行业的价值为12.5亿PSG，而且短期内没有放缓的迹象。但如果目前的销售趋势继续下去，未来香水上的名人面孔可能会少得多。期待你的下一个生日礼物是一瓶让-保罗·高蒂尔，而不是贾斯汀·比伯。名人香水：简史在Facebook、Twitter BBCNewsEnts或BBCNewents的Instagram上关注我们。如果你有故事建议的电子邮件。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 310, "text": "“扭曲光”方法依赖于所谓的光的轨道角动量，这是一种尚未开发的携带数据的手段。现在，包括一些在《新物理杂志》上正式发表评论的研究人员在内的许多研究人员表示，这种想法被误导了。在同一期刊上，该方法的支持者坚持认为，这一想法可以及时大幅提高数据率。这一承诺对那些正在耗尽电磁频谱“空间”的电信公司来说是一个诱人的承诺，因为电磁频谱越来越充斥着通信、广播媒体和数据传输的分配。因此，其他人正在权衡这场可能事关重大的辩论。“如果他们是对的，这将值得获得诺贝尔奖。你能想象，如果所有的通信都可以在一个频率上完成吗？”德克萨斯AM大学的鲍勃·内维尔斯问道，他是电气和电子工程师协会天线和传播学会的前主席。他告诉BBC新闻：“如果他们有这么好的东西，为什么每个人都不跳上跳下？因为我们知道这行不通。”。《新物理杂志》上的分歧为学术期刊上长期以来的公开辩论提供了一个窗口（而不是在问题正式发表之前就进行辩论的日益广泛的方法）：一种有参考文献的“他说，她说”。这个想法背后的原理相当简单。光子是光的最基本单位，携带两种动量，一种运动能量。其中之一，自旋角动量，更为人所知的是极化。光子沿着特定的方向“摆动”，不同的偏振可以通过偏振太阳镜或3D眼镜来分离。但它们也携带轨道角动量——与地球-太阳系类似，自转角动量表示为我们的行星绕其轴线旋转，而轨道角动量表现为我们绕太阳公转。这项新技术旨在利用这种轨道角动量，将更多的数据编码为光波中的“扭曲”。这种现象的存在是毫无疑问的——例如，它最近被用于研究黑洞。目前的争论之所以如此复杂，是因为瑞典空间物理研究所的Bo·蒂德及其同事的实验是否真的使用了它并从中受益。该团队对这一想法进行了非常公开的演示，在《新物理杂志》的一篇文章中首次描述的一次测试中，将数据发送到威尼斯泻湖。但甚至在这篇文章发表之前，其他研究人员就对这种方法的有效性提出了质疑。在《IEEE天线与传播汇刊》上的一篇论文中，隆德大学的Ove Edfors和Anders Johansson认为，正在进行的是一种“多输入多输出”（或Mimo）数据传输，这是一种在20世纪70年代首次概述的技术。Edfors教授在接受BBC新闻采访时表示：“我一直试图与这些人进行讨论，要求他们提出论点，因为他们提出的所有论点都可以用标准理论完全解释。”。“我得到的回复是‘你不明白，你不是物理学家’，我说‘好吧，试着说服我’。”位于瑞士洛桑的瑞士联邦理工学院（EPFL）的Julien Perruisseau Carrier及其同事在本周发表的评论文章中提出了大致相同的论点。但很明显，这场争议是由物理学和工程学学科之间的冲突引起的。佩鲁索-卡里尔教授告诉BBC新闻：“这些人都是物理学家，他们有自己的研究。”。“但作者们正试图将他们的一些工作剥离成一个电信问题。”事实上，正如我们所解释的，他们不明白自己所做的只是一些非常知名和有记录的事情的子集。批评者认为，到目前为止，演示只使用了两种“模式”来传输信息，完美地复制了Mimo的设置，如果Thide教授和他的同事试图将这项工作扩展到承诺的数十种或数百种可能的模式，他们就会失败。Thide教授则坚称，是工程师误解了。“典型的无线工程师，即使是教授，也对角动量一无所知，”他告诉BBC新闻。“这些人提出的观点。。。。与电动力学中的每一本教科书都是矛盾的。这不是我们发明的，而是我们在咖啡休息时发现的——这是基于几个诺贝尔奖的坚实理论基础。“但对这项技术的抵制似乎越来越大。Nevels教授和他在得克萨斯州AM的同事Laszlo Kish在《公共科学图书馆·综合》上发表了一篇论文，他们认为这是它不可能实现的简单而最终的证明，越来越多的学者正在签署成为合著者。Perruisseau Carrier教授表示，这一想法将很快证明自己是有效的。”他们提到他们与电信公司有一些联系，我们很高兴看到这一点。毫无疑问，一旦他们听从真正的专家的意见，人们就会注意到（这个想法有缺陷），”他说，“我们相信这不会有任何进展。\"", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 351, "text": "作为我们对抗这一问题的一部分，我们有一个未被充分利用的工具——食物。在BBC One的《家里的医生》节目中，我试图帮助34岁的Emma Gleeson，她多年来一直在经历焦虑、抑郁和恐慌发作。她19岁的时候才真正开始与心理健康作斗争。在严重的肺炎发作后，她最终在重症监护室昏迷。当她醒来时，她被吓呆了。她对死亡产生了极度恐惧，这可能会引发她的恐慌。在袭击中，Emma感到害怕，经常大声尖叫。这让她的家人非常担心，旁观者也会感到害怕。Emma尝试了各种药物和咨询疗法，但仍在挣扎，每天会有三到四次恐慌发作。我帮助她的方法之一是改变她的食物选择。尽管一开始我持怀疑态度，但我还是向Emma展示了食物在帮助她的精神状态方面隐藏的力量。她说：“从记事起，我就一直以外卖、碳酸饮料、普通加工食品和方便食品为食，一刻也不认为我吃的东西会导致我多年来一直经历的焦虑和恐慌。”。“自从与Rangan博士会面并共度时光以来，他改变了我对食物的整个看法，也改变了为什么某些食物可能会对我的心理健康产生负面影响。”我现在只购买和烹饪新鲜食物，我自己做饭，我吃很多鱼，并努力减少糖的摄入。“我感觉好多了，并打算继续这样下去。”越来越多的证据表明食物与精神状态有关。2015年，著名的《柳叶刀》杂志发表了一篇具有里程碑意义的文章，指出营养对心理健康的重要性可能与对心脏病学、内分泌学和胃肠病学的重要性一样。此外，今年早些时候澳大利亚的一项小型但重要的介入性研究表明，改良地中海饮食在12周内显著帮助了许多严重抑郁症患者。不幸的是，这并没有转化为常规的患者护理，大多数医生仍然不与心理健康患者讨论食物问题。这必须改变。我们中的许多人并不考虑食物会如何影响我们的感受，但我们都知道把食物作为一种快速提神的感觉。当我们感到有点累、有点压力或情绪低落时，我们经常吃一些含糖的零食，以帮助我们在短期内感觉良好。但是，从长远来看，这实际上会使情况变得更糟。你吃的食物真的“震撼”了你的身体。通过改变饮食，减少酒精摄入，Emma的焦虑情绪减轻，情绪改善，恐慌发作减少。她还描述了自己感觉精神更强，头脑更清醒，更有活力，应对压力的能力更强。这也鼓励她在周末更加活跃，做更多的事情，这也有助于她的心理健康。当然，心理健康问题还有许多其他因素需要考虑，从合格的医疗保健专业人员那里获得建议总是值得的。心理健康问题还有许多其他重要因素需要考虑，比如情绪创伤和压力，但我们不应该低估改变食物来改善情绪的力量。作为一名医生，我喜欢赋予我的病人权力。以下是帮助Emma的四个技巧，也可以帮助你：1。减少糖和加工食品糖、含糖的食物，甚至是快速转化为糖的食物（如许多早餐谷物），都会导致血糖迅速升高。在两到三个小时内，你的血糖水平就会开始下降。在这一点上，你可能不仅会感到饥饿，还会感到“愤怒”——饥饿和愤怒。低血糖和血糖水平下降会导致身体应激激素、皮质醇和肾上腺素升高。这会对你的情绪产生负面影响。2.增加Omega-3脂肪的摄入量这是大脑功能的重要营养素，可以预防焦虑和其他精神疾病。富含Omega-3脂肪的食物包括高脂肪鱼类（三文鱼、鲭鱼、凤尾鱼）、草饲肉、种子和叶菜。3.多吃含有色氨酸的食物，如猪肉、鸡肉、种子和核桃色氨酸是一种氨基酸，身体会将其转化为血清素，这是一种感觉良好的神经递质。与健康的碳水化合物来源一起食用，如红薯，这有助于将更多的色氨酸输送到血液中。4.喂养肠道细菌一些科学家将生活在我们体内的数万亿肠道细菌，即肠道微生物群称为大脑的维持者。人们认为，拥有一个健康的肠道菌群会通过肠脑轴对你的情绪产生重大影响。蔬菜中含有的益生元纤维有助于肠道细菌繁殖，因此保持健康的最佳方法是增加蔬菜以及酸菜等发酵食品的摄入量。最好的选择是韭菜、洋葱、大蒜、洋蓟和十字花科蔬菜，如西兰花和花椰菜。你有能力通过控制你盘子里的食物来改善你的感觉。英国夏令时星期一21:00，英国广播公司一台，《豪斯医生》节目，了解食物如何影响心理健康。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 356, "text": "下个月，考古学家将在肯尼亚海岸开始工作，以确定一艘沉船，据信这艘沉船属于一些历史学家认为启发了水手辛巴德冒险的人。本周抵达这个非洲国家的中国考古学家希望这艘沉船能够提供中国与东非首次接触的证据。600多年前，郑的船队启航，进行了七次史诗般的航行，到达了东南亚、中东和非洲。有人说，他甚至比著名的欧洲探险家克里斯托弗·哥伦布早了几十年来到了美国，尽管历史学家对此存在广泛争议。郑被称为“三宝太监”，他在自己的“宝船”上携带着中国皇帝的礼物，船上装载着包括黄金、瓷器和丝绸在内的贵重货物。这些东西沿着既定的阿拉伯贸易路线交换象牙、没药，甚至中国的第一只长颈鹿，促进了对新明朝的认可。但在他去世后的几年里，郑似乎从公众意识中消失了，几个世纪以来，随着中国背弃世界，进入漫长的孤立期，他的传奇故事被忽视了。如今，郑正在享受复兴的喜悦，而他的复兴背后似乎不仅仅是历史的好奇。这艘沉船被认为是郑船队的一部分，该船队于1418年抵达沿海城镇马林迪。中国人似乎有信心在拉穆群岛附近找到沉船，那里已经出现了明代陶瓷碎片。中国政府正在为这一为期三年的联合项目投资200万PSB（300万PSB），肯尼亚表示，希望该项目能提供有关中非早期关系的重要发现。分析人士表示，这与中国在保护自然资源和政治影响力方面对非洲国家的外交姿态非常吻合。郑和，也被称为郑和，被重新誉为民族英雄；被共产党称为中国“门户开放”政策的先驱，这些政策再次使中国成为世界大国。新加坡东南亚研究所的杰夫·韦德说：“中国的崛起引发了很多恐惧。”。韦德教授说：“郑被描绘成中国对世界开放的象征，和平与友谊的使者——这两个词几乎在中国以外的每一个提到郑和的地方都会出现。”。今年早些时候，外交政策的领军人物、中国国务委员戴秉国在与东南亚国家集团东盟主席的会谈中说：“我想向你们保证，中国是不可怕的。”他说，郑和的航行带来了“瓷器、丝绸和茶，而不是流血、掠夺或殖民主义”，指的是西方殖民者使用的暴力胁迫措施。戴说：“直到今天，郑和仍然被人们铭记为友谊与和平的使者。”。中国问题专家爱德华·弗里德曼说，郑和是“帝国”时代的海军上将，当时没有边界，没有边界。威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的弗里德曼教授说：“这些探险是真实的事件——郑的成就非同寻常，是时代的奇迹。”。但郑故事的细节还有待解释，中国政府正在推广的版本为了服务于外交政策而忽略了历史，他说。政治家邓小平被认为是20世纪80年代中国“对外开放”的总设计师，他说中国永远不会寻求霸权。胡锦涛主席多次表示，和平发展是中国政府的战略选择。曾翻译过与郑航海有关的明代文献的历史学家杰夫·韦德教授对一个善良冒险家的形象提出了质疑。他说，历史记录显示，宝藏舰队携带尖端武器，并参与了至少三次重大军事行动；在爪哇、苏门答腊和斯里兰卡。“因为即使是现在，也几乎没有对这些文本进行批判性分析——历史书写仍然掌握在国家手中——中国人很难想象国家是危险的、扩张主义的，或者以任何方式冒犯邻国。”中国的民族主义源于对其过去关系的无知。郑和的形象就是其中的一部分。新加坡的国际郑和协会（International Zheng He Society）对这种“西方思想”表示异议，并称郑卷入的战斗要么是报复性的，要么是为了铲除公海上的海盗。发言人陈建琴（Chen Jian Chin瓦德教授表示：“国际和平与友谊是任何历史遗产。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 369, "text": "但是，当许多人还没有掌握大多数年轻一代认为理所当然的更基本的技术时，老年人想要这些吗？剑桥大学工程设计中心的老年人设计专家伊恩·霍斯金认为，我们首先需要做好基础知识。他说：“周围有一些非常精通技术的老年人，但显然有一大群人感到被技术排斥。他们觉得这有点难以理解。”。我可能会把我的母亲列入后一类。她已经80多岁了，她勇敢地努力掌握各种技术，从破旧的二手电脑到Kindle和网上购物。现在，她想买一台平板电脑，但担心自己不知道如何使用。她并不孤单——根据美国皮尤互联网研究中心的数据，77名老年人需要有人帮助他们完成安装新设备的过程。Breezie专门针对老一代，为标准三星Galaxy平板电脑提供了简化的界面。它可以进行定制，以确保它具有客户想要的设置和应用程序，而不是一堆他们永远不会使用的预设应用程序。他们拥有的Skype很容易使用——例如，想要使用Skype的人只需点击通讯录中朋友的照片。公司创始人Jeh Kazimi告诉BBC新闻，Breezie受到了自己母亲的启发。他说：“我看着她试图在互联网上导航，发现这很吓人，也很复杂。”。“我在市场上找不到任何能让互联网为她服务的东西，所以我自己创建了它。”。去年，该公司与Age UK合作推出了这款平板电脑，售价PS299，预装了Breezie平台。人们很容易认为，老年人会发现一个像你一样简单易用的小工具。作为一名iPad用户，我认为我母亲没有理由不能掌握它，但事实上，它并没有那么简单。苹果屏幕上图标的响应时间为0.7秒，但65岁以上的人的响应时间约为1秒。使用触摸屏对蹒跚学步的孩子来说可能很自然，但对老年人来说不一定——手指的神经随着年龄的增长而变得不那么敏感，这意味着老年人可能会“触摸”得更重。测试表明，如果老年人有轻微的震颤，可以在设备上记录为滑动而不是触摸。Emporia Telecom的发言人克里斯·比格内尔（Chris Bignell）表示：“正是这些微妙的问题侵蚀了人们的信心，造成了混乱。”该公司专门为老年人设计了一款智能手机。它的手机附带了一个应用程序，为人们提供使用触摸屏练习的教程。它还有一个定制的可拆卸键盘，可以翻转手机，供那些仍然想要按钮的人使用。越来越多的科技公司，包括大量的中国制造商，正在开发考虑到年龄和残疾的硬件。这可能意味着更大的按钮、额外的扬声器、助听器兼容性或更长的电池寿命。一些公司，如Age UK的OwnFone，提供一款完全精简的手机，只发送和接收电话，而另一些则旨在满足特定需求。Doro PhoneEasy有大字体和大按钮，而Binatone Speakeasy则内置了紧急按钮。但霍斯金教授表示，对许多老年人来说，这些手机可能看起来不必要地过时，而且有点屈尊俯就。他说：“他们不能全面解决老龄化问题，因为老年人往往有多种障碍。”。随着老年人口的增加，科技行业不能忽视这个问题。据估计，到2030年，美国人口中有19人将超过65岁，与目前拥有iPhone的比例大致相同。到2050年，每两个在职人员中就有一个退休人员。苹果公司正在寻求解决这一问题，但不是用新的硬件。在与IBM的合资企业中，该公司上个月宣布将设计“老年人非常容易使用”的“iPad应用程序”。针对日本市场，这些应用程序将帮助数百万老年人获得医疗服务。霍斯金表示：“它假设其产品本质上是可用的。”。口语交流是美国的一项倡议，通过Skype将居住在养老院的退休人员与在巴西学习英语的学生联系起来。YouTube上的一段服务视频显示，老年人显然很期待聊天，巴西年轻人提高了英语水平，双方都建立了牢固的联系。英国提供了一项类似的服务——云奶奶，让退休人员与印度的孩子联系。最后，我妈妈决定给自己买一台iPad。多年来，我建议母亲买一块平板电脑的建议一直被置若罔闻。然后，她可靠的旧电脑坏了，一个朋友对她自己的平板电脑赞不绝口，接下来我知道的是，她在给我Facetiming。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 436, "text": "硅28是一种好东西，美国的物理学家已经研究出如何生产出纯度比以往任何时候都高40倍的硅。更好的是，他们可以在实验室里完成这项工作，而不是依赖十年前在圣彼得堡一个巨大的、经过改造的钚工厂中制造的样本。这有望解决量子计算研究中的严重供应问题。构建量子计算机的几个最有前途的方案都是基于硅的。一个备受关注的元素将“量子位”存储在另一种元素的原子中，如磷，嵌入一层超纯硅-28中。量子比特是比特的量子替代品，比特是表示传统计算机内部信息的1和0。它们有望开创一个新的计算时代，因为它们可以同时对1和0进行编码，从而实现令人难以置信的快速和复杂的计算。硅基设计的困难在于，普通硅含有相当多的非硅原子-28。商用硅片中几乎有8块是由硅-29等其他同位素组成的，这会对量子芯片造成干扰。马里兰州国家标准与技术研究所的物理学家之一Joshua Pomeroy博士解释道：“这会导致退相干，这有点像计算机中的ADD。”。该领域的研究人员，如Pomeroy博士，一直依赖于从俄罗斯开始的浓缩硅-28的切片。圣彼得堡的设施是一个重新利用的钚浓缩厂，容纳了德国科学家于2004年委托生产的工业规模气体离心机，用于生产纯度为99.99的硅-28样品。该样品被用于结晶5公斤这种物质，成本约为100万欧元，用于国际上从1公斤完美的硅球-28计算阿伏伽德罗数的努力。从那以后，该项目的废料几乎是这种高质量硅的唯一全球来源。Pomeroy博士解释说，量子社区“无法控制资源”来委托进行这种类型的生产。“阿伏伽德罗项目的存在是偶然的，”他告诉BBC。“所以人们有点紧张——当他们最终结束工作，不再购买时，我们该怎么办？”但Pomeroy博士和他的同事们现在已经证明，可以使用许多实验室已经发现的设备生产少量硅-28，其富集度达到前所未有的99.9998。他们用通常用于质谱分析的试剂盒完成了这一壮举，质谱分析是一种根据物质所含不同原子的重量来识别物质的技术。通过将硅离子泵入大磁场，不同的同位素（重量不同的硅原子）可以相互分离，因为较重的原子比较轻的原子被磁铁转移的更少。Pomeroy博士说，这是一个出乎意料的简单解决方案。“我们遇到了科学界经常发生的事情，那就是我们有一种仪器，它的目的已经结束。我们有一个需要解决的问题，我们把它们结合起来。”他的团队可以生产的硅-28薄膜非常非常纯，但也非常小。Pomeroy博士承认：“大量生产要困难得多，但特别是在研究阶段，这些数量在很大程度上是不必要的。”尽管有一些有争议的商业举措，量子计算机主要仍然是一个研究领域。根据Pomeroy博士的说法，这种新方法完全有能力提供足够的比纯硅更纯的硅，供科学家测试他们的设计。重要的是，世界各地的研究人员都有可能在自己的实验室里完成这项工作。他说：“我们认识到，我们不需要生产一整片浓缩硅-28。”。“我们只需要制造足够的材料，就可以将计算机与晶片的其他部分隔离开来。”该团队的研究发表在《物理D杂志》上。在推特上关注乔纳森", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 443, "text": "一段时间以来，人们一直在抱怨F1是否提供了足够的壮观场面，但最近几周，他们的势头越来越大。周一，英国广播公司联合评论员大卫·库塔终于向公众透露了F1中许多人已经知道的事情——车手们不喜欢现在的赛车，因为他们认为它们太慢，太受人为约束。造成这种情况的很大一部分原因在于轮胎，而战略小组周四做出的决定并没有解决这一问题。但很多问题已经得到了解决，F1老板们提出的答案如果得到证实，将在两年后创造一项外观截然不同的运动。头条新闻的变化是2017年恢复加油，汽车的速度将提高到每圈5到6秒。速度的逐步变化将受到车手和粉丝的欢迎——目前的赛车在某些赛道上的比赛速度比2004年慢了10秒。通过改变空气动力学，增加下压力，使汽车看起来“更具侵略性”——更宽的汽车，更大的前后翼和更宽的后轮胎——并通过减轻重量。发动机也将转速更高、声音更大，以解决一些粉丝和F1商业领袖伯尼·埃克莱斯顿对新型涡轮混合动力发动机的抱怨。这将通过将齿轮数量从8个减少到6个来实现，这将迫使团队的转速高于他们现在使用的11000rpm左右，超过15000rpm的限制。工程师们的任务是找到让发动机声音更大的解决方案，也许可以增加另一根排气管。这满足了埃克莱斯顿对更多噪音的需求，同时保留了混合动力车，这对发动机制造商来说很重要。提高燃油流量限制意味着要进行昂贵的重新设计，使发动机能够应对排位赛中大幅增加的功率输出。燃料流量限制——促使工程师们开发热效率超过40的F1发动机——也是这些发动机开发路线的核心——提高了燃料流量限制，它们与当前公路汽车研究的相关性大大降低。在这方面，这些新发动机取得了显著的成功。就在上周末的西班牙大奖赛上，梅赛德斯发动机老板安迪·考威尔（Andy Cowell）谈到了从涡轮增压器中回收能量的设备——被批评为不必要且昂贵——将很快在公路车中广泛采用。在冬季，人们曾讨论过使用1000马力的发动机，但为促进这一点而做出改变的想法已被悄悄放弃。尽管，由于最好的发动机已经达到了900马力左右，但无论如何，通过正常开发，这很可能会发生。汽车和发动机的所有技术变化已经被广泛讨论了几个月，但重新引入加油是出乎意料的。粉丝们在社交媒体上的反应很快，中间出现了分歧——有些人为此欢呼，有些人说这会导致赛道上无法超车。但不难看出老板们可能来自哪里。首先，在任何时候都不必携带最大的燃油负荷的情况下，赛车从一开始就会在比赛中更快，从而消除人们对它们太慢的批评。同样，轮胎上的负荷减少意味着车手可以更用力地推轮胎——这是对倍耐力目前情况的批评，因为用力推会过热轮胎，缩短寿命，所以车手在比赛的大部分时间里往往都很自在。不过，倍耐力必须改变轮胎设计，才能在这方面产生重大影响，因为无论燃油负荷如何，目前的轮胎通常都不能被推平超过几圈。这也让F1的老板们在2016年倍耐力的合同结束后选择哪家公司供应轮胎时有了更大的灵活性。车手们希望拥有可以随时爆胎的轮胎，包括在整个比赛距离内，就像2000年代米其林和普利司通之间的轮胎大战期间，甚至在普利司通从2007-10年起成为垄断供应商的几年里一样。在过去的几年里，很少有人比前倍耐力时代最成功的现役车手费尔南多·阿隆索更挑剔目前的轮胎了。许多业内人士——车手、工程师和车队老板——都会私下承认，他们希望米其林能回来，因为在为赛道比赛提供坚固、稳定、抓地力强的轮胎方面，没有哪家公司受到更高的评价。不过，这是一个很长的机会。埃克莱斯顿在本周的一次采访中明确表示，他并不热衷于米其林回归。他认为这家法国公司将“制造一个坚如磐石的轮胎，你可以在1月安装，12月起飞”，但英国广播公司F1分析师艾伦·麦克尼什立即认为这是不准确的，他在跑车和F1中使用米其林轮胎比赛了18年。但埃克莱斯顿以发表有效的公开声明而闻名，这不一定是因为这些声明与真相有任何关系。资深消息人士表示，现实情况是，这位84岁的球员希望倍耐力留下来，主要是因为这家意大利公司提供了有吸引力的商业条款，而不是任何技术或体育原因。该设备不支持媒体播放。F1将在2017年讨论对其轮胎的要求。埃克莱斯顿已经向资深知情人士表示，新合同几乎肯定会在2017年再次授予倍耐力。加油的回归意味着，无论谁提供轮胎，都可以生产出更耐用的橡胶——司机可以在上面更用力地推更长的时间——而不会有减少进站的风险。这一点很重要，因为埃克莱斯顿认为多次进站是一场精彩F1比赛的重要组成部分。引入加油将意味着每次比赛都会有进站，通常情况下，尽管并非总是如此，但每位车手都会有不止一次进站。这是因为运行更少的燃料所产生的速度优势——每减少10公斤相当于平均0.35秒的圈速。对重新加油有一个主要的反对意见——这很昂贵。团队将不得不支付在世界各地运送所有重型设备的费用，这一费用很可能高达数百万。梅赛德斯F1的老板托托·沃尔夫对这个数字表示质疑，但他补充说，如果成本太高，这个想法就会被放弃——大车队并没有意识到或对小车队的财务负担漠不关心，因为小车队已经发现F1的预算很繁重。对于Lotus、Sauber、Force India和Manor等公司，战略小组几乎没有提供帮助。没有达成任何削减成本的措施，老板们继续追求客户汽车的概念。但这只是一个应急计划，以防一些较小的团队失败。制定的细节不仅仅是红牛或法拉利向小型车队出售汽车。该计划是为了在必要的情况下，让一些车队可以从其他车队购买底盘，如果他们愿意的话——“销售车队”可能包括威廉姆斯这样的车队——他们的预算并不比印度力量或莲花车队高多少——以及迈凯轮和梅赛德斯。或者，如果能够使数字相加，苦苦挣扎的团队可以继续作为客户。没有人真正想要客户的车。战略小组只是为这项运动提供了一个选择，以防小型球队因不幸或管理不善而资金耗尽。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 449, "text": "据信，董事会成员希望大幅削减成本，并更加关注投资银行的业绩。巴克莱银行董事长约翰·麦克法兰表示，该行需要提高效率：“我们需要的是提高利润。巴克莱银行效率不高。我们很麻烦。”巴克莱银行在一份声明中表示，高层需要“一套新技能”。詹金斯自2012年起担任巴克莱首席执行官。该银行表示，正在寻找他的继任者。巴克莱银行董事长约翰·麦克法兰已被任命为执行主席，直至任命新的首席执行官。麦克法兰在电话会议上表示，董事会已决定公司需要改变战略，以促进收入增长。他表示，巴克莱需要“更精简、更敏捷”，以提高公司的资本表现。投资者对这一变化的消息表示欢迎，导致巴克莱银行在伦敦的股价上涨超过2点。麦克法兰先生赞扬了詹金斯先生在带领巴克莱度过金融危机的余波以及三年前巴克莱管理层改组的余波方面所发挥的作用。但他也表示：“毫无疑问，文化变革是迫切需要的。”McFarlane先生告诉BBC商业编辑Kamal Ahmed，詹金斯先生担任最高职位时，他的技能是合适的，但公司的需求已经改变。当英国广播公司问他未来是否会裁员时，他没有排除这种可能性。他也没有排除关闭分行的可能性。麦克法兰表示：“不可避免的是，银行的分行将比现在更少。”。他还告诉英国广播公司，今年晚些时候英超联赛到期后，巴克莱银行将不再继续赞助英超联赛。毫无疑问，巴克莱首席执行官安东尼·詹金斯（Antony Jenkins）因与董事会就投资银行的规模和削减成本的速度发生争执而被解雇。詹金斯于2012年成为首席执行官，他在过去几天被告知，董事会不再相信他是领导该组织的合适人选。资深消息人士告诉我，巴克莱银行副董事长Mike Rake爵士曾与新任董事长John McFarlane接洽，表示一些董事会成员对该行的变革速度感到不满。他们希望进一步削减成本，并更多地关注这家被视为表现不佳的投资银行。人们认为，迈克爵士希望巴克莱银行保持其作为一家主要投资银行的全球业务，而詹金斯先生则认为应该削减这一业务。我已经清楚地知道，在前任首席执行官鲍勃·戴蒙德辞职后，詹金斯先生被视为在稳定银行方面做得很好。但现在是时候换一个新的高层了。在搜寻工作继续进行的同时，麦克法兰将成为董事长兼首席执行官，这一职位与他在保险巨头英杰华担任的职位类似。麦克法兰在巴克莱银行的声明中表示，该行需要提高股东的回报率。“因此，我们需要提高收入、成本和资本表现。”董事会表示，他们认可詹金斯在过去三年中所做的贡献，并“非常感谢他将公司带到了一个更强大的位置。”但该行表示，其非执行董事已“得出结论，需要新的领导层来加快执行步伐。”2012年夏天，在伦敦银行同业拆借利率丑闻后离职的鲍勃·戴蒙德离职后，詹金斯接管了巴克莱银行。该行表示，詹金斯先生继承了一种“会对任何面临同样问题的人构成挑战”的局面。詹金斯先生表示，当他在2012年接任集团首席执行官时，“对巴克莱来说是一个特别困难的时期”。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}

{"idx": 452, "text": "他的妻子玛丽娜仍然记得她最后一次见到他是什么时候。他微笑着，她回忆起那是一种悲伤的方式。她说她明天会回来。“他突然说‘我太爱你了’，”她回忆道。“我说‘是的，当然。我也爱你’。”但当她回到家时，她接到医院的电话，让她赶紧回去。她没有机会再和他说话。当亚历山大·利特维年科躺在病床上奄奄一息时，他仍然是一名训练有素的特工，并试图为警方回忆起可能为他中毒提供线索的每一个细节。对警方来说，他是一个独特的人——一个活着的谋杀案受害者——一个即将死去但有时间与他们交谈的人。那么，他认为谁应对这种神秘的疾病负责呢？这种疾病对他的身体造成了如此可怕的伤害？他的遗孀告诉英国广播公司：“发生在他身上的一切，他都能说话，能签字，他说普京对他的死负有责任。”。公开调查将审查一个核心问题——谁对一名律师在之前的听证会上所说的“伦敦街头国家支持的核恐怖主义行为”负责？这是现代最引人注目、最敏感的谋杀案之一。“这次调查与我参与过的任何其他调查都不同，”当时负责调查的大都会警察反恐司令部负责人彼得·克拉克说。“这不仅是一起谋杀案调查，还有其他关键领域我们必须考虑：公共安全——公共场所、公共交通工具、飞机、办公室、餐馆等40多个放射性污染场所……还有国际层面、外交层面和情报领域。”关于广泛的事件，人们已经知道了很多——亚历山大·利特维年科被放射性的Polonium 210杀死，警方认为两名俄罗斯人亚历山大·卢戈沃伊和迪米特里·科夫顿应该对此负责。据信，他们在伦敦市中心千禧酒店松树酒吧的一杯茶中服用了这种物质。不过，两人都否认与此事有关。不过，这次调查可能会揭示证据线索的新细节——一条放射性线索表明，松树酒吧可能是杀害利特维年科的第三次尝试。但有一个从未公开研究过的问题是动机问题。利特维年科为什么被杀？至关重要的是，这是俄罗斯政府的命令吗？这是本次调查将关注的一个主题。利特维年科曾是FSB官员，后来成为弗拉基米尔·普京的激烈批评者，先是在俄罗斯，后来在英国，他最终获得了公民身份。2014年7月，面对玛丽娜·利特维年科和罗伯特·欧文爵士的压力，政府最终态度缓和，调查正式启动。罗伯特·欧文爵士当时是验尸官，但现在是调查主席。调查过程遇到了一个重大问题——政府要求对某些材料保密，但在调查中没有这方面的规定。因此，Marina Litvinenko和Robert爵士都认为，调查应该转变为公开调查，可以在闭门会议上审议材料。政府起初拒绝，但玛丽娜·利特维年科坚持提出法律挑战，即使她的钱开始用完。7月，政府改变了立场。在某些方面，这被视为对与莫斯科关系恶化的反应。过去有人怀疑，人们希望搁置利特维年科案，重新开始工作，但到去年夏天，乌克兰危机改变了英国对俄罗斯的看法，可能导致英国决定进行调查，调查国家责任问题。在预审听证会上，调查律师表示，英国政府掌握的材料确实为俄罗斯政府在死亡事件中的罪责提供了“初步证据”。但这很可能是秘密情报，不会在公开证据中公布。调查不太可能在公开会议上关注的一件事是亚历山大·利特维年科与军情六处的关系。在一次听证会上，亚历山大·利特维年科遗孀的律师表示，她的丈夫曾为军情六处工作，并有一位化名马丁的专职办案人员或办案人员。律师辩称，这意味着调查需要着眼于英国政府是否没有采取足够的措施保护亚历山大·利特维年科，从而未能履行对他的照顾义务——换句话说，它能阻止谋杀吗？最后，这个问题被排除在最终调查之外。这是一段漫长的旅程。我第一次采访玛丽娜是在她丈夫被谋杀后不久，当时她表现出了揭露真相的决心。八年过去了，她对自己说，在这一追求上，她一如既往地坚定，仍然对英国司法系统提供最终答案的能力充满信心，尽管这一过程中经历了种种起伏。接下来的几个月将是这方面的最后考验。", "label": 1, "source": "xsum_human", "lang": "zh"}
