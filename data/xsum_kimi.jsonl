This therapy, which involves the use of heated cups placed on the skin, is said to have originated in China over 3,000 years ago and has since been practiced across various cultures.\n\nThe process begins with a practitioner lighting a flammable liquid within a small glass cup. As the oxygen within the cup is consumed by the flame, a vacuum is created when the cup is quickly placed onto the skin. This vacuum adheres the cup to the body, creating suction that is believed to draw out toxins and improve blood circulation.\n\nCupping therapy has been touted for its potential benefits in treating a range of conditions, from muscle pain and inflammation to respiratory issues and even anxiety. The marks left on the skin after a session, known as \"cupping bruises,\" are often seen as a sign of the body's detoxification process.\n\nWhile the scientific community remains divided on the efficacy of cupping, with some studies suggesting it may provide short-term relief for certain ailments, others argue that more rigorous research is needed to validate its claims.
